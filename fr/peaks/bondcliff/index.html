It is a subsidiary ridge summit of Mount Bond and is one of the trio of peaks known as The Bonds in the heart of the Pemigewasset Wilderness. Bondcliff is known for its dramatic cliffs along the ridgeline and its sense of remoteness. The summit is above treeline and offers spectacular panoramic views, especially of the neighboring peaks Mount Bond and West Bond and across the wilderness towards Owl’s Head and Franconia Ridge. Bondcliff, like Mount Bond and West Bond, is reached by a long approach and is often hiked as part of an extended loop or traverse.","sameAs":["https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/357730899","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34823632","https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6926"]}}</script>
