It is the northernmost peak on the Appalachian Mountain Club’s list of 4,000-footers in the White Mountains. Mount Moriah is part of the Carter-Moriah Range and stands to the northeast of Pinkham Notch, overlooking the town of Gorham. The summit, reached via the Carter-Moriah Trail (which is also the Appalachian Trail in this section), consists of open ledges that provide excellent views. From Mount Moriah’s summit one can see the Presidential Range to the west, as well as the Carter Range and the Wild River Wilderness. The mountain’s name comes from the Bible (likely named by 19th-century mapmakers), keeping with the theme after nearby Mount Zion and the town of Bethel, Maine to the east.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Moriah_%28New_Hampshire%29","https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/357730423","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6922268","https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6974"]}}</script>
