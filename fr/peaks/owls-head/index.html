It is one of the more remote and challenging peaks on the NH 4,000-footers list to reach, as there is no official trail all the way to the summit (hikers follow unofficial herd paths up a steep slide and through dense woods). The mountain is named for a distinctive rock outcropping on its western side that is said to resemble the profile of an owl’s head. Owl’s Head’s summit is wooded and viewless, but along the ascent of the Owl’s Head slide there are impressive views of the surrounding peaks, including Franconia Ridge to the west and the Bonds to the east. This peak’s isolation and difficult access make it an infamous checkmark for peak-baggers.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl%27s_Head_%28Carroll%2C_New_Hampshire%29","https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/357725208","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7114831"]}}</script>
