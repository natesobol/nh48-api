The mountain was named after Professor George P. Bond (1825–1865) of Harvard University. It is the southernmost peak of the Twin Range in the White Mountains and is situated deep within the Pemigewasset Wilderness. Mount Bond has a bare summit that offers panoramic views, and it is flanked to the north by Mount Guyot. Together with its subsidiary peaks West Bond and Bondcliff, it forms a trio commonly known as “The Bonds,” all of which are included in the list of 4,000-footers.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Bond","https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/357729724","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6919778","https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6924"]}}</script>
