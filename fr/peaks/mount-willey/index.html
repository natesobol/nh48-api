The mountain is named after Samuel Willey, Jr., whose family tragically died in a landslide in Crawford Notch in 1826. Mount Willey is often hiked in conjunction with Mount Field and Mount Tom. The summit of Mount Willey is mostly wooded, with limited views, but a ledge near the summit offers a dramatic view down into Crawford Notch. The steep western face of Mount Willey drops into the notch and is part of the scenic backdrop seen from the area of the Willey House historic site.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Willey","https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/357731065","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6924600","https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6931"]}}</script>
