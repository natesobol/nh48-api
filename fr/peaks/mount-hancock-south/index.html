It is the south peak of Mount Hancock, located in the Pemigewasset Wilderness of the White Mountains. Although it has its own name for listing purposes, South Hancock is a subsidiary summit of Mount Hancock, connected by a ridge and col that drops just over 200 feet, which allows it to qualify as a separate 4,000-footer. The wooded summit of South Hancock offers limited views, but a short distance below the peak there are outlook points with nice views of the Hancock Range and the Arrow Slide on Mount Hancock’s north peak.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hancock_(New_Hampshire)","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6921046","https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5769106492"]}}</script>
