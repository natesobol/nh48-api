It stands on the northwestern side of the Pemigewasset Wilderness and is part of the Twin Range of the White Mountains. The summit area is densely wooded and viewless, marked by a small cairn. Zealand Mountain is known for its remote location and is often accessed via the Zealand Trail and Twinway (which passes by Zealand Falls and Zealand Hut). Although the summit itself has no views, nearby outlooks on Zeacliff along the approach offer stunning views of the Zealand Valley and surrounding peaks.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Zealand","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6924722","https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4898022477"]}}</script>
