        "extendedDescription": "The Kinsman Range spans the western edge of the White Mountains and includes the dome of Mount Moosilauke, Cannon Mountain and the twin summits of North and South Kinsman. Moosilauke’s treeless summit offers wide views across the Connecticut River Valley, while Cannon and the Kinsmans rise above Franconia Notch with rugged ledges and alpine bogs. The range features a mix of moderate to steep climbs, and moose sightings are not uncommon along the forested approaches. Trail conditions vary with season; winter ascents demand traction and preparation for strong winds on exposed summits.",

          "extendedDescription": "The Pemigewasset Wilderness group contains some of the most secluded NH48 summits: Bondcliff, Mount Bond, West Bond, Mount Carrigain, Owl’s Head, and the North and South Hancock peaks. These mountains lie deep within the Pemigewasset Wilderness and require lengthy approaches along valley trails and forested ridges. The Bondcliff ledges and Carrigain’s fire tower offer expansive views, while Owl’s Head and the Hancocks require challenging slide or bushwhack routes. Trails often cross rivers and muddy sections; weather can be unpredictable in the remote interior.",
