    "description": "Bondcliff is a 4,265-foot peak in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. It is a subsidiary ridge summit of Mount Bond and is one of the trio of peaks known as The Bonds in the heart of the Pemigewasset Wilderness. Bondcliff is known for its dramatic cliffs along the ridgeline and its sense of remoteness. The summit is above treeline and offers spectacular panoramic views, especially of the neighboring peaks Mount Bond and West Bond and across the wilderness towards Owl\u2019s Head and Franconia Ridge. Bondcliff, like Mount Bond and West Bond, is reached by a long approach and is often hiked as part of an extended loop or traverse."

It is situated at the northern end of the Franconia Range, overlooking Franconia Notch. Cannon Mountain is known for its nearly vertical east face of cliffs (the site of the former Old Man of the Mountain rock profile) and for the Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway, which carries visitors to near its summit. The mountain is a popular destination for both hiking and skiing (home to Cannon Mountain Ski Area). At the summit, an observation tower provides excellent views of Franconia Notch, the Kinsman Range, and the surrounding White Mountains."

    "description": "Mount Tripyramid, Middle Peak is a 4,140-foot summit in the Sandwich Range of the White Mountains, located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is the middle of the three Tripyramid peaks and the second-highest (after North Tripyramid). Middle Tripyramid is also included in the official 4,000-footers list. Like North Tripyramid, its summit is wooded with no direct views. The peaks are often hiked together via the Mt. Tripyramid Trail (which ascends the steep North Slide and descends the South Slide), and hikers can find good views from the slide areas or from Scaur Ridge nearby. Middle Tripyramid just meets the prominence requirement above the col with North Tripyramid to count as a distinct summit."

    "description": "Mount Field is a 4,340-foot mountain in the Willey Range of the White Mountains, located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It was named in honor of Darby Field, who in 1642 became the first European (recorded) to climb Mount Washington. Mount Field is the highest peak of the Willey Range and is often hiked along with its neighbors Mount Tom and Mount Willey. The summit of Mount Field is wooded, but a short spur path leads to an outlook with views towards Mount Washington and the surrounding area."

    "description": "Mount Garfield is a 4,500-foot mountain in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is part of the Franconia Range and sits at the northern end of the Pemigewasset Wilderness. The summit of Mount Garfield has the stone foundations of an old fire lookout tower and provides outstanding views, especially of the Franconia Ridge (including nearby Mount Lafayette and Mount Lincoln) and down into the Pemigewasset Wilderness. The mountain is typically accessed by the Garfield Trail and is a popular destination for hikers seeking a moderately challenging climb with great payoff in views."

    "description": "Mount Hale is a 4,054-foot mountain in Grafton County, New Hampshire. The mountain is part of the Twin Range of the White Mountains and is situated in the Bethlehem area within the White Mountain National Forest. Mount Hale was named after Reverend Edward Everett Hale (1822\u20131909). Its summit is wooded and capped by a large rock pile left from a former fire tower. Because of the tree cover, there are no sweeping views at the very top, but limited outlooks can be found on the trail during the ascent. Mount Hale is considered one of the shorter and easier 4,000-footer hikes, often climbed from the Zealand Road area."

    "description": "Mount Hancock is a 4,420-foot mountain in Grafton County, New Hampshire. The mountain is situated on the southern side of the Pemigewasset Wilderness in the White Mountains. Mount Hancock was named after John Hancock (1737\u20131793), one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. It is known for its remote location and is often hiked via a loop that also includes its subpeak (South Hancock). The summit of Mount Hancock is forested, with a small outlook near the top that offers views, particularly towards the Osceola range and the heart of the wilderness."

True to its name, it is one of the most isolated peaks in the White Mountains, situated in the Dry River Wilderness area at the southern end of the Presidential Range. Mount Isolation is the highest summit on the Montalban Ridge, which extends south from Mount Washington. Hiking to Mount Isolation requires a long journey (generally 12\u201314 miles round trip), often via Glen Boulder Trail and Davis Path or Rocky Branch Trail and Isolation Trail. The summit of Mount Isolation has an open ledge that yields outstanding views, especially of Mount Washington and the southern Presidentials to the north and of the Pemigewasset Wilderness to the west. Its remoteness and length of hike make it a challenging but rewarding peak for dedicated hikers."

    "description": "Mount Moriah is a 4,049-foot mountain in Co\u00f6s County, New Hampshire. It is the northernmost peak on the Appalachian Mountain Club\u2019s list of 4,000-footers in the White Mountains. Mount Moriah is part of the Carter-Moriah Range and stands to the northeast of Pinkham Notch, overlooking the town of Gorham. The summit, reached via the Carter-Moriah Trail (which is also the Appalachian Trail in this section), consists of open ledges that provide excellent views. From Mount Moriah\u2019s summit one can see the Presidential Range to the west, as well as the Carter Range and the Wild River Wilderness. The mountain\u2019s name comes from the Bible (likely named by 19th-century mapmakers), keeping with the theme after nearby Mount Zion and the town of Bethel, Maine to the east."

    "description": "Mount Passaconaway is a 4,043-foot mountain in the Sandwich Range, located in Grafton County (town of Waterville Valley), New Hampshire. The mountain is named after Passaconaway, a legendary 17th-century sachem (chief) of the Pennacook people. Mount Passaconaway is densely wooded on top; its summit is tree-covered with a small cairn marking the high point. Although the summit itself has no view, a short spur path leads to a clearing with an excellent southward outlook. Mount Passaconaway is often hiked along with neighboring Mount Whiteface, and it is known for its steep, challenging ascents (such as via the Dicey\u2019s Mill Trail or the Walden Trail) and for the wilderness feel of the Bowl Research Natural Area on its eastern flank."

    "description": "Mount Tecumseh is a 4,003-foot mountain in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is the shortest mountain among the 48 NH 4,000-footers. Mount Tecumseh is part of the Sandwich Range and is most famous as the home of Waterville Valley Resort; ski trails cut through its northeastern slope. The mountain was named after the famous Shawnee chief Tecumseh. A hiking trail (the Mount Tecumseh Trail) leads to its summit from the ski area base. The summit is wooded, but a few outlook points near the top, and on ski trails, can provide views towards neighboring mountains like Mount Osceola, and down to the Waterville Valley. Mount Tecumseh\u2019s modest elevation and accessible trail make it a popular hike, especially for beginners working on the 4,000-footer list."

    "description": "Mount Tom is a 4,052-foot mountain in the Willey Range of the White Mountains, located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It was named for Thomas Crawford, a 19th-century innkeeper of Crawford Notch (and part of the family for whom Crawford Notch is named). Mount Tom is often hiked together with neighboring Mount Field and Mount Willey. The summit of Mount Tom is forested with no direct views, but just below the summit, hikers can find viewpoints that offer vistas toward the Presidential Range and down into Crawford Notch. A notable feature on its slopes is the bird population; Mount Tom is known as a good place to spot Canada jays near the summit."

    "description": "Mount Washington is an ultra-prominent mountain in the state of New Hampshire. It is the highest peak in the Northeastern United States at 6,288 feet (1,917 m) and the most topographically prominent mountain east of the Mississippi River. The mountain is notorious for its erratic weather, once holding the world record for the highest wind speed measured at the surface. It lies in the Presidential Range of the White Mountains, in Co\u00f6s County, and its summit area includes the Mount Washington State Park (surrounded by the White Mountain National Forest)."

    ],
    "View Type": "Wooded - summit itself in trees; a cleared outlook near Starr King summit offers fine views of northern Presidentials.",
    "Best Seasons to Hike": "Year-round - popular winter 4k; summer for clear Presidential views from outlook; avoid spring mud.",
    "Exposure Level": "Low - trail entirely in woods; viewpoint at Starr King is a cleared spot but not precipitous.",
    "Terrain Character": "Gentle to moderate grade old bridle path; footing generally smooth with some rocky sections; mossy boreal forest near top",
    "Scramble Sections": "No - steady uphill walk, no scrambles required.",
    "Water Availability": "Limited - no major water sources on trail; an old spring near Starr King summit sometimes flows lightly, but plan to carry water.",
    "Cell Reception Quality": "Spotty - some reception at Starr King outlook facing civilization; generally weak on Waumbek summit.",
    "Nearby Notable Features": "Old stone fireplace/chimney remains at Starr King - site of former fire warden\u2019s cabin., frequent gray jays at summit looking for treats, expansive view to Mount Washington from Starr King clearing",
    "Weather Exposure Rating": "Low - trail sheltered; only concern is typical winter cold at viewpoint.",
    "Emergency Bailout Options": "Only one trail in/out \u2013 retreat down Starr King Trail back to trailhead - short distance relative to other peaks.",
    "Most Common Trailhead": "Starr King Trail parking - off Starr King Road in Jefferson.",
    "Parking Notes": "Small parking area on unpaved Starr King Rd by trailhead sign; if full, park along road without blocking driveways",
    "Dog Friendly": "Yes - one of the easier 4ks for dogs \u2013 moderate grades, no tricky sections, just ensure they have water.",

    "Summit Marker Type": "Wooded summit marked by small cairn or sign - often a little wooden sign on tree at Waumbek summit.",
    "Difficulty": "Moderate",
    "Trail Type": "Out & back",
    "Flora/Environment Zones": "Mixed hardwood and maple at base in old logging areas; transitioning to dense spruce-fir forest above ~3000 ft; summit ridge entirely boreal forest with thick moss, giving a deep woods feel",
    "Nearby 4000-footer Connections": [
      "None - only peak on Pliny Range 4k list, usually done alone; Weeks peaks nearby are lower."

    "description": "Mount Waumbek is a 4,006-foot mountain in Co\u00f6s County, New Hampshire. It is part of the Pliny Range in the northern White Mountains and is the third-highest peak in that range (after Mount Starr King, which is on the same ridge, and Mount Cabot to the east). Mount Waumbek is typically hiked via a trail that passes over Mount Starr King. The summit of Waumbek is wooded, with a limited clearing that provides a restricted view towards the Presidential Range. Being one of the northernmost 4,000-footers, Mount Waumbek is often one of the last peaks hikers climb to complete the NH48 list. The mountain\u2019s name \u201cWaumbek\u201d comes from an Abenaki word, often interpreted to mean \u201cwhite rock\u201d or \u201csnowy\u201d (perhaps referencing its snowy winters)."

The mountain is named after Samuel Willey, Jr., whose family tragically died in a landslide in Crawford Notch in 1826. Mount Willey is often hiked in conjunction with Mount Field and Mount Tom. The summit of Mount Willey is mostly wooded, with limited views, but a ledge near the summit offers a dramatic view down into Crawford Notch. The steep western face of Mount Willey drops into the notch and is part of the scenic backdrop seen from the area of the Willey House historic site."

    "description": "Mount Tripyramid (North Peak) is one of the three summits of Mount Tripyramid in the Sandwich Range of the White Mountains. The North Peak stands at 4,180 feet (1,274 m), making it the highest of the Tripyramid trio. It is located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. North Tripyramid, along with Middle Tripyramid, is included on the Appalachian Mountain Club\u2019s list of 4,000-footers. The two peaks are connected by a ridge and separated by a deep col. The summit of North Tripyramid is wooded, but a hike up its steep North Slide (for experienced hikers) or the gentler approach from the south provides views along the way, and there are limited outlooks near the summit itself."

    "description": "Owl\u2019s Head is a 4,025-foot mountain deep in the Pemigewasset Wilderness of the White Mountains, in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is one of the more remote and challenging peaks on the NH 4,000-footers list to reach, as there is no official trail all the way to the summit (hikers follow unofficial herd paths up a steep slide and through dense woods). The mountain is named for a distinctive rock outcropping on its western side that is said to resemble the profile of an owl\u2019s head. Owl\u2019s Head\u2019s summit is wooded and viewless, but along the ascent of the Owl\u2019s Head slide there are impressive views of the surrounding peaks, including Franconia Ridge to the west and the Bonds to the east. This peak\u2019s isolation and difficult access make it an infamous checkmark for peak-baggers."

    "description": "South Kinsman Mountain is a 4,358-foot mountain in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is the higher of the two main peaks of Kinsman Mountain, which is part of the Kinsman Range in the White Mountains. South Kinsman is the sixth most prominent peak in the White Mountains and marks the highest point between Franconia Notch and Kinsman Notch. The summit is mostly open with scrub vegetation, offering expansive views westward and into the Franconia Range. South Kinsman, together with North Kinsman, is considered one of the New Hampshire 4,000-footers since the two peaks are separated by enough elevation drop to qualify individually."

It is located in Lincoln, New Hampshire (Grafton County), deep in the Pemigewasset Wilderness. West Bond is one of three peaks collectively known as The Bonds (along with Mount Bond and Bondcliff). Although lower than Mount Bond, West Bond is notable for its solitude and the excellent views it offers of the surrounding wilderness, including a close perspective of Bondcliff\u2019s dramatic cliffs."

It is part of the Carter-Moriah Range of the White Mountains and faces Carter Dome across Carter Notch. Wildcat A is the highest of the multiple summits of Wildcat Mountain, and one of two (along with \u201cD\u201d Peak) that count as official 4,000-footers. The summit of Wildcat A is wooded, but a ledge near the top provides a dramatic overlook of Carter Notch and the steep eastern slopes of Mount Washington."

    "description": "Zealand Mountain (sometimes called Mount Zealand) is a 4,260-foot mountain located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It stands on the northwestern side of the Pemigewasset Wilderness and is part of the Twin Range of the White Mountains. The summit area is densely wooded and viewless, marked by a small cairn. Zealand Mountain is known for its remote location and is often accessed via the Zealand Trail and Twinway (which passes by Zealand Falls and Zealand Hut). Although the summit itself has no views, nearby outlooks on Zeacliff along the approach offer stunning views of the Zealand Valley and surrounding peaks."

It is the highest peak in the Pilot Range of the White Mountains and the northernmost of New Hampshire\u2019s 48 four-thousand footers. Mount Cabot is named (indirectly) for the Cabot family or possibly the explorer John Cabot, and it lies within the Kilkenny region of the White Mountain National Forest. The mountain is heavily forested. Its summit has a clearing (where a fire lookout tower once stood) but only obstructed views; however, nearby viewpoints on the trail, such as Bunnell Rock, offer nice vistas to the south and east."

It overlooks Franconia Notch and is known for its steep, triangular-shaped summit profile. The summit of Mount Flume is partly open and provides excellent views, especially north along Franconia Ridge to Mount Liberty, Mount Lincoln, and Mount Lafayette, and east into the Pemigewasset Wilderness. It is commonly hiked as part of the Franconia Ridge loop or via the Flume Slide Trail (a very steep route) or the more gradual Osseo Trail."

Although it has its own name for listing purposes, South Hancock is a subsidiary summit of Mount Hancock, connected by a ridge and col that drops just over 200 feet, which allows it to qualify as a separate 4,000-footer. The wooded summit of South Hancock offers limited views, but a short distance below the peak there are outlook points with nice views of the Hancock Range and the Arrow Slide on Mount Hancock\u2019s north peak."

    "description": "Mount Osceola, East Peak (often simply called East Osceola) is a 4,156-foot mountain in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. It is a subordinate peak of Mount Osceola, located to the east of Osceola\u2019s main summit along the ridge in the town of Lincoln (Grafton County). East Osceola is reached via the Greeley Pond Trail and Mount Osceola Trail, typically on the way to or from the main summit of Mount Osceola. The summit of East Osceola is wooded and marked by a cairn, offering little in terms of views. Despite its lack of vistas, it counts as a separate 4,000-footer due to the prominence drop between it and Mount Osceola."

It is the lower of the two main summits of Kinsman Mountain (South Kinsman being higher). North Kinsman qualifies as a separate 4,000-footer due to the prominence between it and South Kinsman. The summit of North Kinsman is wooded and lacks a view, but a short bushwhack to ledges just east of the top reveals excellent views, including of Kinsman Pond below, South Kinsman nearby, and the opposing Franconia Ridge across the valley."

    "description": "Wildcat Mountain \u201cD\u201d Peak is a 4,050-foot summit on Wildcat Mountain, located in Co\u00f6s County, New Hampshire. It is at the northwest end of the Wildcat Ridge, directly above the Wildcat Mountain Ski Area in Pinkham Notch. Wildcat D is one of two summits of Wildcat Mountain recognized as 4,000-footers (the other being the higher \u201cA\u201d Peak). The summit of Wildcat D is the site of the top of a gondola lift and an observation deck, from which there are spectacular views across Pinkham Notch to Mount Washington and the Presidential Range. Wildcat D Peak is often the starting or ending point for hikers traversing the Wildcat Ridge Trail, which runs from Pinkham Notch over Wildcat\u2019s peaks and on toward Carter Dome."
