    "desc": "A low-growing alpine blueberry found near mountain summits, at the extreme southern edge of its range in the White Mountains. This deciduous shrub forms mats on exposed ridges and plateaus, providing blue-black berries beloved by alpine birds and small mammals. Its leaves are almost round, green with a bluish tint that turns purple-red in fall, and the flowers are white to pale pink bells hiding under the foliage. In late summer it bears juicy bilberries (similar to blueberries) that help seed new plants via animal dispersal. Though locally common in some alpine pockets, overall it is a rare treasure of the Presidential Range, a remnant of colder climates.",
    "morph": "Dwarf woody shrub only ~4–8 inches tall, with many wiry branches. Leaves alternate, <1/2 inch (8–14 mm) long, rounded at tip and without teeth, with a smooth edge and slight blue-green waxy hue that can redden in cold. They are thin and drop off in winter. Stems are greenish-brown, and new twigs often green. Flowers are tiny urn-shaped (blueberry-like) blooms, white or pink, in clusters on twig tips. The fruit is a dark blue-purple berry ~1/4 inch across, with a whitish bloom on the skin.",

Mountain cranberry’s leaves also remain through winter, unlike the bilberry’s dropping foliage.",
    "ecology": "An alpine tundra specialist that withstands intense sun, wind, and cold. It often roots in shallow gravelly peat or sheltered pockets near rocks, tolerating both moist boggy spots and dry ledges. Uniquely, this species can accumulate heavy metals in its leaves from mineral-rich soils and has even been studied as an indicator of uranium-rich geology. Its berries feed alpine wildlife (birds like grouse and mammals such as voles), and its low, dense form offers shelter for tiny creatures. In winter it may be insulated by snowpack. As one of the few berry-producing plants at high elevation, it plays a key role in the food web above treeline.",
    "status": "Southernmost populations occur on New Hampshire’s highest peaks, making it regionally rare. It is listed as a species of concern in some areas (e.g., Special Concern in Maine). In the White Mountains it is not abundant and considered a protected alpine plant – hikers are urged to avoid trampling its fragile mats. Climate warming could further restrict its habitat. Globally, however, it is widespread across boreal and arctic regions."

In the Howker Ridge area, spruce (primarily Red Spruce, with Black Spruce in harsher spots) mixes with balsam fir to create a boreal forest carpeted in moss. These evergreens are adapted to cold climates: their narrow, spiky crowns shed snow and resist wind. Near ~4,000–4,500 ft the spruce become stunted and contorted, crouching low under persistent winds – branches often bare on the windward side and green on the leeward, forming one-sided “flag trees.” This transition zone signals you’re approaching alpine heights. The air here is filled with the sharp, resinous scent of spruce needles.",
    "morph": "Medium-sized evergreen conifer at lower subalpine elevations (commonly 20–60 ft tall), but only a few feet tall in krummholz. Needles are stiff, four-sided and sharp to the touch (~0.5 inch long), arranged all around each twig. They are dark green to yellow-green. Twigs are rough, covered in tiny woody pegs (sterigmata) that remain after needles drop – a key spruce ID feature (fir twigs are smooth). Bark is thin, gray-brown and scaly. Cones (the seed-bearing structures) hang downward from branches; Red Spruce cones are ~1.5 inches long with thin, flexible scales, while Black Spruce cones are smaller (~1 inch) and may persist on branches. Spruce produce pollen cones in spring (shedding yellow pollen) and woody seed cones by late summer.",
    "similar": "Spruces are often confused with their high-elevation companion, Balsam Fir (Abies balsamea). You can tell them apart: fir needles are soft, flat, and arranged mostly to the sides of the twig (and have a friendly fragrance when crushed), whereas spruce needles are prickly, four-angled, and encircle the twig. Fir bark has raised resin blisters, unlike scaly spruce bark. Another spruce lookalike at lower elevations is Eastern Hemlock, but hemlock has much shorter, flat needles and drooping leader tips. Between spruce species: Red Spruce (common on slopes) has somewhat larger cones and reddish-brown twigs, whereas Black Spruce (found in bogs and frigid crags) has very short, often clustered needles and tiny persistent cones – though hikers will mostly notice their similarly spindly, spire-like forms.",
    "ecology": "Spruce forms the backbone of the mountain boreal ecosystem. Its dense stands create cool, shaded habitat for mosses and shade-tolerant understory plants. Spruce seeds feed birds like crossbills and red squirrels, and its boughs shelter snowshoe hares and the endangered Bicknell’s Thrush, a rare songbird that breeds only in high-elevation spruce–fir forests. In the krummholz, prostrate spruce catch and hold drifting snow, which insulates the ground and provides moisture for alpine plants. Spruce are shallow-rooted in thin mountain soils and thus prone to blowdown; in some areas you’ll see “fir-wave” patterns of fallen trees and regrowth. Historically, high-elevation red spruce suffered heavy damage from acid rain and winter freeze injury, but with cleaner air some stands are rebounding. As climate warms, however, the cool, moist zone they occupy is expected to contract upslope, potentially reducing spruce extent in the Whites.",
    "status": "Red Spruce and Black Spruce are common in the White Mountain region and not individually threatened. They have both been extensively logged in the past (red spruce lumber was valuable for instruments and construction), but many stands in WMNF have recovered under protection. Spruce–fir forests as a whole are considered a conservation concern because of their limited area and sensitivity to climate change. The krummholz zone (~4,000–4,500 ft) is a fragile community – hikers must stay on trail to avoid damaging the living spruce mats that might be centuries old. Overall, spruces in the Whites are holding their ground currently, but their long-term future depends on preserving cold mountain conditions."

Labrador Tea grows ~1–2 ft tall, with leggy branches topped by clusters of small white flowers in early summer. Its namesake leaves were historically brewed as a tea by indigenous peoples and woodsmen for their spicy aroma. Hikers might notice its rusty-brown, fuzzy leaf undersides – an adaptation to cold and drought. Along Howker Ridge, look for Labrador Tea in mossy hollows or protected ravine heads just below treeline, often alongside sedges and cranberries. When in bloom (mid-June through July), it brightens the alpine wetlands with bundles of white starry blossoms atop the green shrubs.",
    "morph": "A short, spreading shrub up to 2 feet tall. Leaves are evergreen, 1–2 inches long, narrow elliptical with edges strongly rolled under. The upper surface is shiny dark green and leathery, while the underside is thickly coated in warm brown woolly hairs – feel the felted texture beneath. Leaves are alternately arranged and emit a medicinal, pine-like scent when crushed (owing to aromatic oils). Stems are woody and often gnarled near the base. In June, flower clusters (umbels) of 6–12 white flowers appear at twig tips. Each flower has 5 ragged white petals and a spray of long, projecting stamens, giving a starburst appearance. By late summer they form small seed capsules; no fleshy fruit is produced.",
    "similar": "Shares its peatland home with other heath-family shrubs. Bog Laurel (Kalmia polifolia) also grows on alpine bog hummocks – but bog laurel has oppositely arranged, smooth-edged leaves (without fuzzy undersides) and showy pink cup-shaped flowers rather than white clusters. Sheep Laurel (Kalmia angustifolia) at lower elevations is another pink-flowered bog shrub to distinguish. Labrador Tea’s hairy leaf underside is a unique trait; even the somewhat similar Lapland Rosebay has scales rather than thick fuzz below its leaves. Also, Labrador Tea tends to a more sprawling form, whereas true rhododendrons (like Lapland Rosebay) form tighter cushions. If not in bloom, the brownish woolly leaf underside is the best giveaway for Labrador Tea.",
    "ecology": "A classic component of acidic peat bogs and alpine fens. Labrador Tea thrives on waterlogged, acidic soils, often rooting directly in sphagnum moss. It tolerates cold and nutrient-poor conditions that few other shrubs can. The dense leaf hairs help reduce water loss and may protect against frost and intense sun at high elevations. Its evergreen leaves start photosynthesis as soon as conditions allow, giving it a head-start in the short alpine growing season. Leaves contain toxic alkaloids which deter most herbivores – even moose tend to leave it alone – and thus the plant can dominate peatland shrub layers. In spring, its nectar-rich flowers attract hardy bog pollinators like flies and native bees. Labrador Tea is a pioneer of mossy, disturbed ground as well; after glacial retreat, it helped colonize raw peat. The species is widespread across the boreal world, reflecting its adaptability to cold wetlands.",
    "status": "Labrador Tea is secure and common in its specialized habitats. In New Hampshire it can be found from sea-level bog preserves up to alpine tarns. It is not considered rare – indeed, it is one of the more conspicuous alpine shrubs in sheltered spots. However, peatland draining or excessive foot traffic in alpine bogs could harm local colonies. Within WMNF and alpine zones, it is protected by conservation measures. Its presence above treeline (in “moss lawns” behind rocks) is a reminder that even subalpine species can creep into the alpine given a bit of shelter. There are no special conservation listings for Labrador Tea in this region, though botanists monitor alpine populations to ensure their health under changing climate conditions."

Mountain Cranberry forms creeping mats of glossy, dark green leaves only 1–3 cm long. In early summer it bears tiny bell-shaped flowers, white to light pink, hiding under the leaves. By late summer, the plant lives up to its name – producing bright red, tart berries that resemble small cranberries. Along Howker Ridge and Mount Madison’s summit, you’ll find patches of this shrub nestled between rocks or in sheltered lee of dwarf spruce, often mixed with alpine bearberry and bilberry. Despite its delicate appearance, it’s a hardy survivor of exposed ridgelines and tundra. Hikers may recognize it as the same lingonberry beloved in Scandinavian jams (though in the alpine zone, it’s best left for the wildlife!).",
    "morph": "A prostrate, evergreen shrub only 2–8 inches tall, often forming extensive mats via creeping woody stems. Leaves are opposite to alternately clustered, oval and thick, leathery, about 1/4–1/2 inch long. The upper surface is shiny dark green, underside paler with tiny blackish dots. They remain green year-round under the snow. In June, nodding clusters of 2–6 urn-shaped flowers bloom at stem tips. The flowers are pinkish-white, with a waxy texture and reflexed petal tips. Fruits are glossy red berries ~1/4 inch wide, ripening in late August and often persisting into autumn. Stems are slender, woody, and root at nodes, which helps the plant spread as a groundcover carpet.",
    "similar": "Mountain Cranberry’s evergreen mats can resemble Bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), another trailing shrub with red berries. However, bearberry has larger paddle-shaped leaves (with a net-veined underside) and blooms with different white urn flowers in spring. In alpine zones, bearberry is less common than Mountain Cranberry. Alpine Bilberry (Vaccinium uliginosum), which may grow alongside, differs by being deciduous with broader bluish leaves and dark blue (not red) berries. Also, bilberry’s leaves are seasonally red-tinted and drop in winter, whereas Mountain Cranberry’s remain green. Partridgeberry (Mitchella) has red berries too but is a trailing vine in shaded forests, not in windy alpine turf. The combination of thick evergreen leaves + red berry in an exposed alpine or bog setting is a sure sign of Mountain Cranberry.",
    "ecology": "An alpine evergreen strategy allows this plant to photosynthesize as soon as conditions permit in spring, giving it an advantage in the short alpine summer. Its creeping growth stabilizes thin soils and cushions the ground, creating microhabitats for insects and other seedlings. The bright red berries are a critical food source for alpine birds (like grouse and ptarmigan) and small mammals, who in turn disperse the seeds in their droppings. Mountain Cranberry often grows in association with sphagnum moss in bogs and with lichens and sedges in alpine meadows. It prefers acidic, nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme cold and desiccating winds by staying low-profile. Under winter snowpack, its leaves endure freezing temperatures and then quickly resume function come snowmelt. Because it occupies both low bogs and high summits, it may be somewhat resilient to climate shifts, though shrinking alpine zones could limit its high-elevation range.",
    "status": "Widespread across the northern hemisphere (circumboreal), Mountain Cranberry is secure globally and in New England. It is a characteristic species of New Hampshire’s alpine flora and is monitored but not considered threatened. It even persists in some lowland bog preserves. Still, its alpine populations occupy a narrow zone above treeline (~4400+ ft), which faces pressure from warming climate and heavy hiker traffic. In the Presidential Range, it is one of the “common six” alpine plants tracked for phenology changes. Conservation in WMNF focuses on protecting its alpine habitat (by maintaining scree and bog integrity and guiding hikers) rather than the plant itself, as it remains abundant in suitable areas."

    "desc": "Sphagnum is the lush, sponge-like moss carpeting peat bogs and alpine wet areas. It forms thick, bouncy mats of bright green (sometimes red-tinged) foliage that squelch underfoot with water. Along Howker Ridge, you might spot sphagnum in seepy streamlets or soggy soil pockets near springs. This moss is a master of water: historically, dried sphagnum was used as a superior wound dressing and diaper material because it can absorb ~20 times its weight in liquid and is naturally antiseptic. Its presence signals very acidic, nutrient-poor conditions, yet it creates critical habitat – building deep peat that supports orchids, pitcher plants, and alpine bog communities. The vibrant emerald or chartreuse patches of sphagnum bring a bit of wetland oasis even to high mountain ridges, where it may lie in sheltered, late-melting snow hollows.",
    "morph": "A primitive moss with no true roots, forming dense cushions or floating mats. Sphagnum plants are tiny (a few inches tall) but grow intertwined in masses. Each stem has whorls of threadlike branches with many overlapping tiny leaves that resemble tufts or pom-poms at the tip. These leaves have unique empty cells that hold water like a sponge. The moss is often soft and springy to the touch (like squeezing a damp sponge). Color ranges from vivid green to reddish brown depending on species and sun exposure. In the growing season, small brown spore capsules may be visible on slender stalks emerging from the mat – when dry and pressurized, they pop, shooting spores into the air. Because it lacks flowers or seeds, reproduction is via spores and fragmentation of the moss carpet.",
    "similar": "When forming a carpet, sphagnum could be mistaken for other mossy groundcovers, but a close look and feel distinguishes it. Haircap Moss (Polytrichum) can form hummocks too, but has coarse, starry-tipped stems and is less spongy. Other bog mosses (e.g., Warnstorfia or Calliergon) may grow in wetlands, but Sphagnum’s extreme water-holding capacity, layer-cake peat deposits, and often reddish growing tips set it apart. Its texture – both squishy and velvety – is unique. There are many Sphagnum species; hikers may not tell them apart, but all perform similar ecological roles. If you encounter a floating quaking mat of moss that can even support your weight briefly, that’s likely Sphagnum at work.",
    "ecology": "Sphagnum moss is an ecosystem engineer of wetlands. By holding water like a sponge, it maintains the saturated, anoxic conditions of peat bogs. As it grows on top, older layers below die and accumulate as peat, sequestering huge amounts of carbon over millennia. Its tissues release acids that keep the environment inhospitably acidic for most plants and decay microbes – thus peat builds up rather than decomposes. This means sphagnum bogs preserve organic materials (even thousands-year-old plant remains or “bog bodies”). In alpine zones, patches of sphagnum create miniature wetlands that support specialized plants (dwarf willows, sedges, Labrador tea) beyond the treeline. These mossy areas also provide moisture to nearby plant communities during dry spells. Sphagnum has a symbiotic relationship with these bog plants: it acidifies and waterlogs the soil, which favors acid-loving species that in turn shelter the moss from sun. Because it’s so absorbent and antiseptic, it played an important historical role as field bandage material in World War I. Protecting sphagnum-rich habitats is key for water regulation and carbon storage in the White Mountains.",
    "status": "Globally, Sphagnum moss is common and underpins entire wetland ecosystems. In the White Mountains, it’s present from lowland swamps to alpine fens and is not endangered – often it’s the habitat itself (peatlands) that is of conservation concern. Alpine bog communities with sphagnum are considered rare and sensitive natural communities due to limited area and vulnerability to climate change (drying) or trampling. Within WMNF, many sphagnum bogs are protected from development. Climatically, peat moss may face stress if temperatures warm significantly or precipitation patterns shift, but it has survived since the Ice Age. As long as cool, wet conditions persist, this resilient moss will continue to flourish and quietly perform its water-filtering, carbon-storing duties."

In the Presidential Range alpine, it forms extensive mats on windswept, rocky ground, often alongside other cushion plants and sedges. The lichen’s growth is shrubby and intricate: a tufted thicket of branching, brittle stems only a few inches tall. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils where little else can grow. When moist, it becomes soft and pliable, even a bit springy; when dry, it turns crisp and can crumble under a boot. Reindeer Lichen is extremely cold-hardy – a true Arctic-Alpine survivor – and in northern boreal regions it’s a crucial winter forage for caribou (hence the name). Hikers in the White Mountains will see its ghostly mats decorating alpine ledges, talus fields, and open spruce-fir woods with a subtle frosty hue.",
    "morph": "Not a plant but a symbiotic amalgam of fungus and algae, this lichen has a distinctive appearance. It consists of many whitish-gray branching stalks (the lichen’s thallus) that stand upright 1–4 inches high. Each branch repeatedly forks into three or four segments, creating a bushy, finely divided structure like minuscule antlers. There are no leaves or obvious fruiting bodies as seen on plants; the surface is matte and can be slightly greenish or brownish in parts. Under magnification, you’d see no true outer cortex on the branches – just a tangle of fungal threads wrapped around algal cells. The lichen does not produce showy cups or visible spores in the field; it primarily spreads when pieces break off and reattach (a form of clonal reproduction). When wet, the clump darkens a bit and feels spongy; when dry, it is pale, almost white, and easily crushes (hence very susceptible to boot damage).",
    "similar": "Several other gray-white Cladonia lichens share its habitat. One in particular, Cladonia portentosa, is often intermingled and also called “reindeer lichen.” These can be hard to tell apart without close examination; generally, C. rangiferina has slightly thicker branches at more acute angles. In the field guide context, both are ecologically similar. Iceland Moss (actually a lichen, Cetraria islandica) may grow nearby; it’s darker and more foliose (leafy flakes) rather than shrub-like. “Deer moss” is another colloquial name used for the same Cladonia group. No true moss or vascular plant looks like these reindeer lichens. Their dry, crunchy, bushy mats on open ground are unique – just avoid confusing them with patches of gray dead moss or shrub fragments. The living lichen often has a subtle greenish cast when hydrated.",
    "ecology": "Reindeer Lichen is a pioneer species in harsh, barren landscapes. It can colonize bare rock or mineral soil, secreting acids that slowly help break down rock into soil – thus facilitating later plant succession. It has no roots; it absorbs water and nutrients from rain and air across its surface, which means it’s very sensitive to air quality (sulfates or smog can kill it). In alpine and subalpine zones, its mats help retain a bit of moisture and reduce erosion by covering soil. It grows extremely slowly (only a few millimeters per year) and can take decades to recover after disturbance. This lichen provides critical winter food for caribou/reindeer in subarctic regions, though in NH the woodland caribou are long gone. Still, micro-fauna like insects or spiders may use its tangle for shelter, and birds sometimes pick lichen for nest lining. Its presence on White Mountain summits links these peaks to far northern tundra ecosystems. Because it is so slow-growing, trampling by hikers can eliminate it from heavily used alpine trail edges – hence the importance of walking carefully on rocks where possible. Globally, Cladonia rangiferina is common (NatureServe “Secure”), but locally it benefits from alpine zone conservation efforts.",
    "status": "Not rare – in fact quite common in alpine and barren habitats across the Northern Hemisphere. In the White Mountains it forms an integral part of the alpine community and lower-elevation pine barrens. It has no special protection status, though it is indirectly protected as part of conserved natural communities. The main concern is its vulnerability to damage: a footprint can crush centuries of growth. Therefore, land managers emphasize Leave No Trace principles in lichen-rich areas. Air pollution historically reduced lichen abundance in some industrial regions; relatively clean mountain air has allowed reindeer lichen to flourish here. Overall, this species is holding steady, but it reminds us that alpine life can be both hardy and fragile – hardy in surviving cold and drought, yet fragile against human impact."

    "desc": "Perhaps the most striking of our alpine flowers, Lapland Rosebay is a diminutive rhododendron that lives in the unforgiving felsenmeer (fields of frost-shattered rock) on a few Presidential peaks. This plant forms low cushions tucked into cracks and crevices where a bit of soil collects and wind is slightly broken. In late May or June, it unveils surprisingly large and showy magenta blossoms – a welcome burst of color against the gray rocks. Each bloom is a funnel-shaped rhododendron flower about 1–1.5 cm across, with five spreading lobes and protruding stamens, colored deep pink to purple. The shrub itself is only 4–8 inches tall, with a few woody stems and clusters of small, leathery evergreen leaves. It is an arctic-alpine relic, meaning its nearest relatives are far to the north. Seeing Lapland Rosebay in bloom is a special treat for White Mountain hikers – it’s a brief spectacle, often finished by early July. By autumn, the plant fades back into the rocky background, spending most of the year as inconspicuous green sprigs clinging to life in a narrow niche.",
    "morph": "A prostrate evergreen shrub that forms mats or clumps up to 8 inches tall and perhaps a foot across. Leaves are opposite or in tight clusters on short stems, oval to oblong, only 1/4–3/4 inch (6–20 mm) long. They are thick (coriaceous) and dark green above, pale brownish below with minute scales and hairs. The leaf margins are smooth and often rolled under slightly, and the undersides have a scurfy or downy texture (adapted to reduce water loss). Twigs are gnarled, covered in flaky brown bark. In spring, flower buds (formed the previous year) open into 1–3 showy flowers at the branch tips. Flowers are bright purple-pink (occasionally paler), about 1/2 inch across, shaped like mini azalea blossoms with 5 lobes. They tend to face upward, each held by a short fuzzy stalk. Inside are ~8 stamens with purple anthers. After blooming, a small woody capsule develops, which later splits to release fine seeds. The entire plant often grows in tight clumps, hugging the ground for warmth and wind protection.",
    "similar": "In the alpine zone, the only thing remotely similar is Alpine Azalea (Kalmia procumbens, formerly Loiseleuria). Alpine azalea also has pink flowers and evergreen leaves on mountaintops. However, its flowers are much smaller, star-shaped and pale pink, and it has opposite tiny leaves only 2–4 mm long. Alpine azalea forms creeping mats, whereas Lapland Rosebay forms more clumped cushions and larger solitary flowers. Bog Laurel (Kalmia polifolia) might also be confused when not in bloom – bog laurel has similar-sized evergreen leaves – but it grows in wet alpine bogs and has rose-pink cup-shaped flowers; its leaves are opposite with smooth green undersides (no scales). Compared to Labrador Tea (another heath in alpine bogs), Lapland Rosebay’s leaves are smaller and scaly beneath (not fuzzy) and of course its purple flowers differentiate it. Because Lapland Rosebay is so rare and restricted, most hikers will encounter it only in specific spots; if you see a pink rhododendron-like flower on Mount Washington or Madison’s summit areas, it’s this species and not likely anything else.",
    "ecology": "Lapland Rosebay is an arctic-alpine specialist, found only in isolated high-elevation refugia in NH, Maine, and arctic regions. It has survived since the last ice age on these wind-scoured summits. Ecologically, it occupies the most barren alpine barrens and cliffs, finding microhabitats where a bit of moisture and protection allow survival. It often grows on the leeward side of boulders or in slight depressions that trap soil and snow. The plant’s evergreen, hair-coated leaves conserve water and withstand freezing, while its low stature avoids the worst of the winds. By blooming very early (often while snowbanks still linger), it likely ensures pollination by the first hardy insects of spring – its vivid flowers providing an important nectar source for alpine bumblebees and flies. Seeds are wind-dispersed across the rockscape, but successful germination is rare. It often grows with other cushion plants like diapensia and alpine azalea, forming a unique community on frost-heaved talus. Snow cover in winter actually benefits it by insulating from desiccating winds; the challenge comes in summer when the sun can bake the thin soil – hence it stays in cooler crevices. Overall, Lapland Rosebay’s presence signals a relatively undisturbed alpine environment and a direct link to the flora of far northern tundras.",
    "status": "This species is rare in New Hampshire and considered a threatened plant in the state due to its limited range. It reaches its southern range limit in the White Mountains. There are only a few known populations (on summits like Mt. Washington, Monroe, Lafayette, Katahdin etc.), often in small numbers. The NH Natural Heritage Bureau tracks it as a species of concern. In WMNF, its habitat is protected (much of it lies in Alpine Zone Research Natural Areas). Visitors are urged to stay on rocks and established paths to avoid crushing this and other alpine gems. Climate change poses a significant long-term threat – as temperatures rise, the cool alpine microclimate it needs could shrink, and competitive lower-elevation plants might encroach. For now, it persists as a relic population, and seeing its blossoms is a highlight for alpine botanists. Lapland Rosebay is a symbol of our alpine conservation efforts: tiny, beautiful, and tenaciously holding on."

    "desc": "This oddly named lichen, also known as Fairy Barf or Candy Lichen, certainly catches the eye: imagine a splash of mint-green crust on a decaying log, peppered with tiny bright pink polka dots – as if a fairy had a too-sweet snack and, well, you get the idea. Fairy Puke Lichen grows on very rotten wood, moss, or peat in humid, shaded forests. Along the lower Howker Ridge Trail, you might find it on moss-covered stumps or downed spruce logs in the shady understory. The pink “dots” are its apothecia – spore-producing structures – and are a true bubblegum pink, about 1–2 mm across. They can be sparse or so numerous that they almost cover the greenish thallus. Finding this lichen delights hikers with an eye for tiny things; it’s like discovering a secret fairy world on a stump. Despite the playful appearance, it’s a fully functioning symbiosis of fungus and algae, breaking down wood and adding splashes of color to the forest floor.",
    "morph": "A crustose lichen forming irregular patches (up to several inches across) on rotted wood or soil. The main body (thallus) is a thin, pale green to bluish-green crust that grows over moss or decayed wood fibers. Often it’s so integrated that you can’t peel it off without crumbling the substrate. Embedded in this crust are the distinctive apothecia: round, convex discs that are pink to salmon in color, usually ~1 mm in diameter (about the size of a pinhead). These may sit directly on the thallus or on very short stalks. When wet, the pink apothecia can look gelatinous; when dry they are duller. The combination of green thallus and pink dots is unmistakable. If you scrape a bit of the green crust, you’d see it has no obvious structure like leaves – it’s a granular layer of fungal tissue with algae. No stems, no leaves, no flowers – it’s a lichen through and through.",
    "similar": "Fairy Puke Lichen might be confused with the Pink Earth Lichen (Dibaeis baeomyces), which also has pink apothecial dots. The difference is substrate and structure: pink earth lichen grows on soil, often on bare ground or sand, and its pink apothecia are atop slightly longer stalks, giving a miniature “lollipop” look. Fairy Puke prefers well-rotted logs or very mossy soil and appears more as a flush on a surface, with sessile (nearly stalkless) pink dots. Also, Dibaeis usually lacks the bright mint-green smooth crust that Icmadophila has. Other crustose lichens on wood (like Graphis or Phlyctis) have gray or black fruiting bodies, so they don’t resemble Fairy Puke at all. One could mistake the pink apothecia for fungal fruit bodies (like tiny coral fungus tips), but under a hand lens the context of a green lichen thallus is clear. In short: bright pink on green, on rotten log = Fairy Puke likely.",
    "ecology": "Icmadophila (Fairy Puke) is found in cool, damp forests, often indicating well-established or old-growth conditions where plenty of logs are decomposing. It “eats” decaying wood in a sense – the fungal partner physically grows through rotten logs, and the algal partner photosynthesizes to feed them both, making it a partial autotroph. It often overgrows mosses on logs; in fact it is described as growing aggressively over mosses on well-rotted wood and peat. By breaking down logs, it contributes to the nutrient cycling in the forest, albeit slowly. It has no known direct economic importance (aside from looking pretty), but it does signal a healthy, moist microclimate. It likely relies on consistent humidity; if a forest is cut and dries out, this lichen can disappear. It does not tolerate pollution well and prefers pristine air and water drip conditions. In the White Mountains, it can occur up into subalpine elevations wherever old stumps persist (for example, krummholz edge where a tree died and rots). Spore dispersal (from those pink apothecia) helps it colonize new logs, but it’s not a fast-spreading species. Overall, Fairy Puke lichen plays a subtle role in forest ecology – one of countless organisms quietly decomposing and enriching the soil.",
    "status": "This lichen is not rare globally – it’s found across the Northern Hemisphere’s forests (even in some arctic areas). However, it can be locally uncommon because it needs specific conditions (very decayed wood, constant moisture). In New Hampshire it’s recorded in many counties but never in large abundance. It has no special conservation status. The main threat would be loss of habitat: overly tidy forestry that removes dead wood, or severe pollution drying out or poisoning substrates. The good news is that within the White Mountain National Forest, plenty of rotting logs and pristine air means Fairy Puke has its niche. Its presence often goes unnoticed by all but keen observers. Conservation of old-growth forest patches and maintenance of coarse woody debris in forests indirectly ensure this quirky lichen continues to delight hikers who take the time to look closely. If you find it, enjoy the find and maybe snap a photo – but do not disturb it, as lichens are slow-growing and sensitive."

    "desc": "Scattered along moist trail edges or in alpine grassy patches, these little orange mushrooms catch the eye against green moss. “Orange Cone Mushroom” refers to a waxcap in genus Hygrocybe – likely the Witch’s Hat (Hygrocybe conica) or a close relative – known for a bright orange to reddish-orange conical cap often dripping with slime in wet weather. Caps are usually 1–3 cm wide, vividly colored like a citrus peel or traffic cone, sometimes with a pointed top. The gills beneath are waxy, thick, and pale yellowish-white, and the slender stalk is orange. These mushrooms tend to appear singly or in small groups on mossy soil or among sedges in late summer. On Howker Ridge, one might fruit near a spring or on a soggy alpine meadow when conditions are just right. Because of their intense color, they look almost like wildflowers from a distance, until you realize it’s a fungus. Some waxcaps (like the Witch’s Hat) even bruise black if handled. Though not abundant, finding one is a delightful reminder that even the alpine zone has its fungi working behind the scenes.",
    "morph": "A small gilled mushroom (cap-and-stem form) belonging to the waxcap family (Hygrophoraceae). Cap: bright orange (sometimes with red or yellow tones), convex to sharply conical, about 1–5 cm diameter. Surface can be moist and waxy or slimy (especially in fresh fruiting), smooth in texture. Cap margin often splits with age; flesh thin. Gills: attached to the stem, rather thick and widely spaced, waxy in consistency, colored pale yellow to orange. They produce white spores. Stem: up to 5–8 cm tall, slender (a few mm thick), orange to orange-yellow, and lacking any ring or veil. It is smooth and somewhat brittle. Notably, these waxcaps have no volva or ring and do not exude milky sap (distinguishing them from other orange fungi). Many Hygrocybe are characterized by having brightly coloured, waxy caps and white spores with smooth, bare stems, which fits this mushroom. Some species (e.g., H. conica) will slowly turn black on cap and gills as they age or if bruised – a characteristic “blackening” reaction. There is no prominent odor or taste (and they’re generally considered inedible).",
    "similar": "Several other orange mushrooms might cause confusion. Jack-o’-Lantern Mushroom (Omphalotus illudens) is large, clustered on wood, and has true, non-waxy gills (plus it glows faintly); it wouldn’t be found in alpine lawns. Orange Mycena species (tiny bell-shaped mushrooms) appear on logs or leaf litter and have more fragile, duller orange caps and thin, closely spaced gills. Waxcaps (Hygrocybe spp.), by contrast, tend to have that distinctive waxy/slimy cap and thicker gill spacing. Within waxcaps, the color can vary: Golden Waxcap (Hygrocybe flavescens) is yellow-orange but with a flatter cap; Scarlet Waxcap (Hygrocybe coccinea) is redder and more bell-shaped. The “Orange Cone” form with a pointed top and blackening trait points to Hygrocybe conica (Witch’s Hat) as the likely species. Hikers simply noting a solitary day-glo orange mushroom on the ground in moss – not growing on wood – have almost certainly found a waxcap. No toxic lookalikes occur in that specific niche above treeline, but as always, one should not eat wild mushrooms without expert ID.",
    "ecology": "Waxcap mushrooms like this Hygrocybe are part of the alpine and forest decomposer community. Interestingly, unlike many fungi, waxcaps are not strongly associated with dead wood or specific host plants; instead, they often fruit in old, undisturbed soils with mosses or grasses (in Europe, “waxcap grasslands” are famous for their diversity of Hygrocybe). They likely live on decaying organic matter in the soil (leaf litter, dead roots) or possibly in loose association with mosses or soil microbes (scientists call them “biotrophs” since they may glean nutrients in a non-destructive way from the ecosystem). In the alpine zone, soil is thin and nutrient-poor, so waxcaps may take advantage of the slow decomposition environment to pop up during the brief wet periods. They do not appear every year in quantity – their fruiting is weather-dependent, often after good rains followed by warmth. When they do fruit, they release spores into the air to colonize other suitable mossy soils. Ecologically, their bright color might attract insects or invertebrates that help spore dispersal, though that’s speculative. As part of the fungal community, they help break down organic residues, albeit likely slowly. They are sensitive to changes in soil chemistry – in Europe, some are declining due to fertilizer use; in the Whites, any significant disturbance to the alpine meadow (trampling, pollution) could reduce their occurrence. But in general, these waxcaps are harmless, ephemeral guests of the alpine-subalpine habitat, gone soon after they appear.",
    "status": "No specific conservation concerns apply to this organism in our region. The genus Hygrocybe has many species worldwide, and while a few European grassland species are in decline due to habitat loss, the particular orange waxcaps in the White Mountains are not tracked as rare. They are infrequent simply because alpine fungi in general fruit sporadically and sparsely. As long as the alpine and subalpine environments remain intact and free of heavy pollution, these vivid mushrooms will continue to pop up occasionally. They serve as indicators of undisturbed, low-nutrient soils – in fact, finding waxcaps can signal that an area has not been polluted by nitrogen or disturbed by livestock. In the White Mountain alpine zone (which has no grazing and minimal soil impact aside from hikers), the conditions remain suitable. Thus, the Orange Cone Mushroom is a delightful but not endangered component of the high-mountain ecosystem. Hikers are encouraged to enjoy it visually and leave it undisturbed, as with all mushrooms, since it’s part of the natural nutrient cycle."

Along the beginning of the Howker Ridge Trail and other disturbed areas, it springs up quickly after events like logging or fire, being one of the first plants to colonize bare ground. Its stems reach 2–5 feet tall, topped by branching, pyramid-shaped clusters of tiny yellow daisies that bloom in late summer. These vibrant plumes sway above lance-shaped, toothed leaves. Because it spreads aggressively by wind-dispersed seeds and creeping rhizomes, goldenrod can dominate meadows – sometimes forming near-monocultures on abandoned fields. Hikers will notice masses of goldenrod painting the landscape golden in August and September, a sure sign of late summer in New Hampshire.",
    "morph": "An upright perennial wildflower 2–4+ feet tall. Leaves are alternately arranged on the stem, 4–6 inches long and narrow lanceolate, with serrated edges and a rough texture. The central stem is often lightly hairy (especially on the upper parts). In bloom, the inflorescence is a feathery panicle curving outward or to one side, composed of hundreds of tiny flower heads. Each flower head has a few bright yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, providing a nectar-rich platform for insects. After flowering, small tufted seeds (achenes with white fluff) are produced, aiding wind dispersal. The plant’s base often has multiple shoots arising from a common rhizome, creating clumps of stems.",
    "similar": "Several other goldenrods share its general appearance. Rough-stemmed Goldenrod (Solidago rugosa) and Giant Goldenrod (Solidago altissima) are very similar tall yellow species; they can be told apart by subtle differences in leaf hairiness and teeth. In shady woods, **Zigzag Goldenrod (S. flexicaulis)** grows shorter with broader leaves and a zigzag stem. Importantly, goldenrod pollen is heavy and insect-carried – contrary to popular belief, it **does not** cause hay fever (wind-borne Ragweed pollen is the real culprit). Thus, Canada Goldenrod’s showy blooms advertise nectar to pollinators, not allergens to people.",
    "ecology": "This wildflower is a keystone of late-season ecology. Its abundant pollen and nectar sustain a wide array of insects – bumblebees, solitary bees, honeybees, wasps, flies, beetles, butterflies, and moths all flock to goldenrod blooms. In fact, goldenrods (with asters) support more species of butterflies and moths than almost any other native perennials. After flowering, the seeds are eaten by finches and sparrows, and the dried stalks provide winter cover for insects and spiders. Goldenrod stands also harbor goldenrod gall insects (like gall flies and moths whose larvae overwinter in the stems, providing food for woodpeckers and chickadees). Deer will browse goldenrod foliage occasionally, though it’s not their top choice. In nutrient cycling, goldenrod’s annual dieback adds organic matter to soil. While highly beneficial for wildlife, its vigorous growth can crowd out more delicate plants – a reason it’s sometimes considered weedy. However, within its native range it contributes greatly to biodiversity and soil stabilization on disturbed sites.",
    "status": "Extremely common and widespread in New England – not at risk. Canada Goldenrod thrives in human-altered landscapes and can even become invasive outside its native range (it’s considered an aggressive invader in Europe and parts of Asia). In the White Mountains region, it’s a ubiquitous late-summer wildflower of roadsides, clearings, and riverbanks. No special protection is needed; in fact, it often requires management to control its spread in gardens or restoration plots. Its abundance makes it a readily available resource for pollinators. Overall, Canada Goldenrod is secure globally (NatureServe ranks it G5 Secure). Its “weedy” success reflects its adaptability – but also underscores the value of such pioneer plants in revegetating and enriching barren areas."

It grows 1–3 feet high and gets its name from its habit of bending slightly at each leaf node, creating a subtle zigzag pattern in the stem. You’ll find it in the lower hardwood forests along Howker Ridge Trail, where dappled sunlight breaks through – its short spires of yellow flowers bring patches of brightness to shady spots. Unlike the big plume goldenrods of open areas, this species bears **small clusters of yellow flowers in the upper leaf axils** and at the stem tip. Its leaves are large for a goldenrod: 3–6 inches long, ovate with pointed tips and sharply toothed edges, resembling a small sunflower or elm leaf. The foliage is somewhat papery or slightly hairy. In late summer, each plant produces dozens of tiny golden flower heads hugging the upper stem, which are very attractive to woodland butterflies and bees. The overall look is a more delicate, open spray of flowers compared to the dense goldenrod panicles of sunnier habitats.",
    "morph": "A herbaceous perennial with an unbranched, lightly zigzag stem 1–3 ft tall. Leaves are alternate, widely oval to egg-shaped with serrated margins and a pointed tip. They have short petioles and a conspicuous network of veins; lower leaves can be up to 6–8 inches long, upper leaves smaller. The stem is often green or tinged purple and may be slightly hairy. Flower heads are borne in **small clusters (3–10 florets each)** arising from the leaf axils on the upper part of the stem, plus a terminal cluster at the top. Each tiny flower head has 4–6 yellow ray florets and a yellow center. After blooming, it forms small seed-like achenes with tufts of whitish bristles. The plant spreads slowly via shallow rhizomes, often forming loose patches in favorable spots.",
    "similar": "In shady habitats, **Blue-stemmed Goldenrod (Solidago caesia)** is another yellow woodland goldenrod, but it has more slender arching stems with a bluish cast and its flowers are usually fewer and directly in leaf axils (often giving a more spaced look). Zigzag Goldenrod’s leaves are broader and its stems more kinked. **Large-leaved Goldenrod (Solidago macrophylla)**, found in northern New England forests, also has big leaves but usually a single club-like cluster of flowers at the top, rather than zigzagging blooms along the stem. People sometimes confuse goldenrod with wildflorests that cause allergies – however, Zigzag Goldenrod’s pollen is insect-distributed and not a hay fever trigger (wind-pollinated Ragweed is to blame). The bright yellow color might also be mistaken from afar for woodland sunflower, but that plant has much larger ray petals and blooms earlier in summer.",
    "ecology": "As one of the few fall-blooming wildflowers in deep woods, Zigzag Goldenrod is important for forest pollinators. Its nectar feeds late-season butterflies (like commas and tortoiseshells) and native bees seeking sustenance in September. Caterpillars of some moths (such as the Broad-winged Spanworm moth) feed on goldenrod foliage in the understory. Because it tolerates heavy shade and clay-rich soils, it often grows in rich sugar maple or maple-oak forests, contributing to the herb layer diversity. Deer and rabbits may nibble the leaves, but generally it’s not heavily browsed thanks to mild bitterness. Interestingly, Zigzag Goldenrod has been exonerated from causing hay fever – its showy flowers rely on insects, and the plant even supports goldenrod-specialist insects like gall midges (though galls are rarer on this species than on field goldenrods). Ecologically, it helps stabilize soil on wooded slopes with its rhizomes and adds organic matter as its leaves die back each year. And in fall, its little sprays of gold extend the blooming season in habitats where most plants have finished flowering, thus sustaining pollinator networks for a few extra weeks.",
    "status": "Common and secure in its native range. Zigzag Goldenrod is widespread across eastern North America’s forests and faces no major conservation threats. It benefits from forest management practices that maintain shade and undisturbed leaf litter (it thrives in old-growth or mature second-growth woods). As a rhizomatous plant, it can recolonize recovering forests after logging, though it may be temporarily reduced in heavily disturbed soil. Globally, NatureServe ranks it G5 (Secure). It is not listed as endangered or threatened in any New England state. In fact, gardeners sometimes grow it for shade gardens as a native ornamental. In the White Mountains, it is a familiar understory wildflower at lower elevations. Overall, Zigzag Goldenrod is abundant and in no danger – its challenges are more garden-related (it can self-seed modestly but is far less aggressive than field goldenrods) rather than ecological. It remains a resilient piece of the woodland puzzle."

    "teaser": "A delicate lavender-blue aster that froths along woodland edges in autumn, offering late nectar to butterflies with its airy sprays of starry blooms.",
    "desc": "Blue Wood Aster (also known as Heart-leaved Aster) is a charming wildflower that brings a haze of soft color to late fall woodlands. It often grows 1–3 feet tall, with slender branching stems that become topped with **billowy clusters of pale blue or violet star-like flowers**. True to its name, its lower leaves are heart-shaped (cordate) with serrated edges, about 2–4 inches wide, though upper leaves are smaller and more lance-shaped. This aster thrives in partly sunny, partly shady spots – such as trail edges, road banks, or forest gaps. Along Howker Ridge’s lower trail or old logging paths, you might see its sprays of many small flowers brightening the understory in September when few other blooms remain. Each flower is about 1/2 inch across, with 10–20 thin lavender rays around a yellow center that turns reddish with age. The stems are often a dark purple or reddish color, which along with the dusky blue petals gives the plant a subtle beauty. Blue Wood Aster often grows in loose colonies, seeding itself freely and popping up in disturbed soils or along stone walls. By late summer, its many buds burst into bloom, giving a ‘cloud’ of light blue that can be eye-catching in dappled light.",
    "morph": "A clumping to spreading perennial reaching 1–3 ft in height. The stems are thin, sometimes woody at the base, and can be purple or green. Basal and lower stem leaves are heart-shaped (broadly ovate with a deep cordate base where the leaf clasps a short petiole) and coarsely toothed; these may wither by flowering time. Upper leaves are smaller, more lanceolate, and attached without petioles (sessile). The plant branches near the top into a loose, open panicle of flower heads. Each head consists of a dozen or more pale blue or light purple ray florets and a central cluster of tiny yellow disk florets that later turn orange or red. The overall inflorescence has a airy, diffuse appearance (not a single dense cluster, but many small flower heads on thin stalks). After bloom, each fertilized head forms a seed-like achene with a tuft of white hair (pappus) that aids wind dispersal, allowing the aster to spread around a site.",
    "similar": "Many other **asters** bloom around the same time, but Blue Wood Aster is distinguished by its habitat and leaf shape. **White Wood Aster (Eurybia divaricata)** shares the heart-shaped leaf and woodland habitat but has white ray florets and usually fewer flowers on each branch. **Large-leaved Aster (Eurybia macrophylla)** also has big leaves and pale lavender flowers, but its foliage forms more of a groundcover and it has far fewer, larger flower heads. **New England Aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae)** and **New York Aster (S. novi-belgii)** have similar purple flowers but prefer open sunny meadows and have hairy or narrow leaves, not heart-shaped ones. Some might confuse Blue Wood Aster with **Common Blue Aster** in gardens, but the wild Blue Wood Aster tends to have a more loose, wiry form and thrives in partial shade. Overall, the key is the combination of small bluish flowers, late bloom time, and ovate, heart-based leaves which set it apart from other fall composites.",
    "ecology": "As a late-blooming woodland wildflower, Blue Wood Aster provides vital nectar and pollen for pollinators preparing for winter. It’s particularly favored by native bees and skippers, and serves as a **great late-season food source for migrating butterflies** like monarchs and painted ladies (which may stop to sip from its many flowers). Additionally, it’s a host plant for some moth larvae and is noted as a \"pollinator powerhouse\" plant because of the sheer number of insect visitors it supports. Songbirds such as goldfinches and sparrows will occasionally eat the tiny seeds in late fall, and small mammals might nibble tender young foliage in spring. In the ecosystem, Blue Wood Aster often pops up in disturbed ground (e.g., along trails or after a tree fall), helping to quickly cover and stabilize soil with its fibrous roots. It tolerates dry, rocky soils well and thus can grow where many woodland plants cannot, contributing to plant diversity in tough sites. It has moderate shade tolerance, which allows it to persist under shrubs or open forest canopy, though it flowers best with some sun. In urban or developed areas, this aster can even thrive in vacant lots or at woods edges, proving its resilience. By blooming in September–October, it extends the flowering season in forests, which helps sustain late-flying pollinators and adds splashes of color when most other plants have finished for the year.",
    "status": "Widespread and secure. Blue Wood Aster is common throughout New England and much of the eastern United States, especially in semi-open woods and edges (NatureServe ranks it G5 Secure). It is not under any conservation concern in the White Mountains; in fact, it often benefits from light disturbances like trail maintenance or forest thinning, which create the partial sunlight conditions it favors. Because it hybridizes occasionally with other asters and readily self-seeds, its genetic diversity is robust. There are no known diseases seriously threatening it – powdery mildew can affect leaves late in the season, but this is a minor issue. Some horticultural interest exists (gardeners appreciate its shade tolerance and late bloom), but it’s not widely cultivated beyond native plant enthusiasts. In the wild, Blue Wood Aster populations are stable; they rebound quickly after events like logging as long as some seed sources remain nearby. The biggest “threat,” if any, is heavy leaf litter or invasive groundcovers that could smother seedlings, but generally this aster finds niches to persist. Overall, it continues to be a plentiful component of the region’s flora, lighting up forest edges each autumn."

    "desc": "Flat-topped White Aster, sometimes called Parasol Whitetop, is a robust wildflower found in wetter pockets of the mountains. It commonly grows 3–5 feet tall, unbranched except near the top where it bears a **broad, flat-topped cluster of white blossoms**. You might encounter it in soggy clearings or along streams below Howker Ridge, where its bright white flower clusters stand out against the grasses and goldenrods in August. The plant’s leaves are long (3–6 inches), narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, arranged alternately up the stem. Near the top, the stems branch into a wide panicle (almost like a candelabra) of dozens of small daisy-like flower heads. Each head has 10–15 white rays around a yellow center. In full bloom, a single plant looks like it’s carrying a **bouquet of mini-daisies all in one plane**, hence “flat-topped.” The effect can be quite showy, especially when masses of these plants bloom together in a damp meadow. Flat-topped Aster often forms colonies via rhizomes, spreading in favorable wet soil. It’s an important species in high-elevation swamps and upland marshes in the White Mountains, often growing alongside joe-pye weed, swamp goldenrod, and sedges.",
    "morph": "A tall, erect perennial 3–6 ft in height, often with a reddish or green smooth stem. The stems are usually unbranched until the inflorescence. Leaves are numerous, up to 6 inches long but only ~1 inch wide, lanceolate with a tapering tip and sometimes a slight toothed edge; lower leaves may have short petioles, upper leaves are sessile (clasping the stem). The inflorescence is a **flat-topped compound umbel or panicle** – many branchlets of roughly equal height bearing flower heads, giving a level-topped appearance from above. Each flower head is about 1/2 inch across, with 8–15 white ray florets and a central cluster of yellow disk florets (which age to a dull cream). The rays are somewhat irregular in length, giving the daisies a slightly ragged look. After bloom, it produces small wind-dispersed achenes with a tuft of bristles. The plant’s roots are fibrous and it also has creeping underground rhizomes, allowing a clump to expand outward over years.",
    "similar": "Flat-topped Aster is distinctive in having a large, flat-topped inflorescence of many small white flowers. Other white asters in the region either have more rounded clusters or bloom later. **White Wood Aster (Eurybia divaricata)** grows in shade, is shorter (1–2 ft) and has only a few blossoms per cluster. **Fall (Frost) Aster (Symphyotrichum pilosum)** sometimes has a broad array of white flowers, but it’s a shorter, bushier plant of dry fields with fuzzy stems. **Boltonia (Boltonia asteroides)** has a similar large spray of white daisies but is more common in cultivation or low wetlands further south. Non-aster lookalikes include **Thoroughwort (Eupatorium perfoliatum)**, which has flat-topped white flower clusters but they are fuzzy and lacking ray petals. If the plant is tall, in a moist meadow and topped with a platter of small white daisy flowers in mid-late summer, it’s likely Flat-topped Aster.",
    "ecology": "This species thrives in mountain wetlands and provides valuable services there. It attracts a variety of pollinators: bees, wasps, small butterflies, skippers, and especially many types of flies frequent the nectar-rich flowers. Its bloom time (midsummer to early fall) overlaps with late-season pollinator activity, and it serves as a **larval host for the Harris’ Checkerspot butterfly and Pearly Crescentspot**, which lay eggs on aster leaves. Insects feeding on its nectar become prey for spiders and birds, thus integrating the plant into the food web. The seeds (small achenes) have tufts that aid dispersal by wind and may also be eaten in small amounts by seed-eating birds or rodents. Because Flat-topped Aster often grows in colonies, its thick stands can help bind soil in wet meadows and stream margins, reducing erosion during floods. It also offers some cover to frogs, toads, and insects in marshy areas – standing tall above grasses and sedges. In winter, the dried seed heads persist and can catch drifting snow, contributing to a microhabitat that insulates overwintering insects at ground level. Ecologically, it is a resilient plant tolerant of both water-logged soils and periodic drying, helping it persist in the fluctuating water conditions of mountain wetlands.",
    "status": "Flat-topped White Aster is generally common across its range (eastern North America) and is not considered threatened. In New Hampshire and the broader White Mountain region, it’s a typical component of wet meadows and riparian zones. It is listed as secure globally (NatureServe G5). Locally, occurrences can be abundant where habitat is suitable – for instance, in beaver meadows or along brook edges – and it often benefits from habitat disturbances like beaver activity that maintain open wetland conditions. One potential local threat is succession: if a meadow grows up into forest, this sun-loving aster will decline. It is also sensitive to prolonged drought since it prefers moist soil, so extended dry spells (which may increase with climate change) could reduce its vigor in some sites. However, it has a broad distribution from Canada to the southern Appalachians, indicating high adaptability. No conservation measures are targeted specifically at this aster, but wetland protection efforts indirectly conserve it. In summary, Flat-topped Aster is currently doing well and remains a widespread, thriving wildflower in its habitats."

    "teaser": "A tiny evergreen vine that carpets the forest floor with glossy paired leaves and bright scarlet berries, quietly decorating the woods year-round.",
    "desc": "Partridgeberry is a low-growing, **trailing evergreen herb** that forms mats on the forest floor of the White Mountains. Along the Howker Ridge Trail’s lower sections, you can spot its creeping stems weaving through moss and leaf litter, often around the bases of trees or on rotten logs. The plant is only about 2 inches tall, consisting of slender, woody runners that root at the nodes and can spread out yards across the ground. Its leaves are opposite (in matching pairs along the stem), round-oval in shape, about 1/2 inch across, dark green with a distinct whitish midrib. These thick, glossy leaves remain green even under the snow. In early summer, Partridgeberry produces tiny white flowers in pairs. Each pair of flowers has a fuzzy, trumpet-like shape and a sweet fragrance. Notably, the two flowers in a pair are fused at the base and will produce a single berry. By fall, you’ll see the result: a small, bright red berry (1/4–1/3 inch) dotted with two little dimples or “eyes” on its surface – a mark of its twin-flower origin. These scarlet berries often persist through winter, adding a welcome pop of color against the snow or brown leaves. Partridgeberry’s overall appearance is delicate and unobtrusive – a tapestry of tiny green leaves and occasional red beads at your feet as you hike through mature woods.",
    "morph": "A creeping perennial vine that lies prostrate on the ground. Stems are very thin (1 mm or so), woody and trailing, often reddish-brown, and root at intervals (wherever a leaf node touches soil). Leaves are arranged in opposite pairs; each leaf is rounded to oval, with a smooth margin and a short petiole. The upper leaf surface is shiny deep green with a pale midrib and sometimes faint white veins; underside is lighter. Flowers come in pairs at the end of short stems (axils) in June–July. Each flower is tubular (about 1/2 inch long) with four petal lobes at the tip that spread open, giving a star shape. The interior of the flower tube is hairy (giving it a frosted, white fuzzy look). Two flowers are joined at their base (sharing an ovary). After pollination, this twin-ovary develops into **one berry**. The berry is bright red, spherical, with two small spots on it (the “fusion scar” from the two ovaries). Berries are often present on the plant from late summer through the winter (they are not particularly juicy and thus do not rot quickly). The plant’s form is a thin mat – it does not climb, but simply runs along the ground. Over time it can form a loose carpet intermixed with mosses and other low plants.",
    "similar": "Other low evergreen plants share the forest floor but are easily distinguished. **Wintergreen (Gaultheria procumbens)** also has red berries and evergreen leaves, but wintergreen’s leaves are alternate (not paired) and larger, with a distinct wintergreen scent when crushed; it also has a single white bell-shaped flower that leads to each berry, whereas Partridgeberry’s berries have two “eyes” from twin flowers. **Twinflower (Linnaea borealis)** is another vine-like forest creeper with paired pink flowers, but it does not have persistent berries and its leaves are more scalloped. **Trailing Arbutus (Epigaea repens)** has evergreen trailing stems, but its leaves are much larger, leathery, and it bears clusters of pink-white flowers in spring with no showy fruit. Partridgeberry’s combination of tiny opposite leaves, twin fuzzy flowers, and red berry with dual dimples is unique. Its evergreen carpet might sometimes be mistaken for young strands of moss or clubmoss from a distance, but up close the differentiated leaves and berries set it apart as a flowering plant.",
    "ecology": "Partridgeberry plays a modest but steady role in forest ecosystems. Its bright red berries are edible for wildlife (though almost tasteless to humans). Many birds and mammals consume them opportunistically: Ruffed Grouse, Wild Turkeys, and quail will peck at the berries, and small mammals like white-footed mice, red squirrels, and foxes eat them too, although these fruits make up only a small fraction of their diet. Because the berries persist into winter, they can provide a mid-winter snack when other foods are scarce. The evergreen leaves are not a preferred food for deer, but deer may nip them occasionally if other browse is limited. As a groundcover, Partridgeberry helps stabilize the soil and retains moisture in the leaf litter layer. Its creeping vines intermix with mosses and help prevent erosion on forest floors, especially on slight slopes. The dense mats also offer microhabitats – small insects and spiders may shelter under its leaves, and amphibians like salamanders might find humid refuge in patches of Partridgeberry. The white flowers are fragrant and produce nectar, attracting small bees and moths. Interestingly, each plant has flowers of one of two forms (“dimorphic heterostyly”) – a mechanism to encourage cross-pollination by insects. Ecologically, Partridgeberry is a low-light specialist, thriving in the filtered light under a closed canopy where few other flowering plants can survive. It does not tolerate open, hot conditions well, so it is a good indicator of intact, mature forest understories with minimal disturbance.",
    "status": "Very common and not of conservation concern. Partridgeberry ranges widely across eastern North America and is frequently encountered in appropriate habitats from Canada to Florida. In the White Mountains it is ubiquitous in northern hardwood and mixed forests, often forming continuous mats in some locales. Its trailing habit and evergreen nature make it resilient: even if above-ground stems are scuffed or grazed, it can re-sprout from rooted nodes. The species is not sensitive to logging as long as some canopy remains; it often survives selective timber harvest and can recolonize areas if some forest floor remains intact. It is not considered invasive (it’s too slow-growing and low) and in fact is sometimes cultivated as a native groundcover. Globally, it is listed as secure (G5). There are no major threats – even forest fires typically burn the leaf litter but Partridgeberry can regrow from protected portions or seed. Its berries likely aid in its dispersal via birds. One minor threat could be heavy foot traffic: repeated trampling on trailside colonies can damage its delicate stems. Hikers are advised to stick to trails to avoid unnecessarily damaging patches of Partridgeberry and other small understory plants. Overall, its status is stable, and it continues to grace the forest floors without need for special protection."

    "teaser": "A primitive, fern-like plant carpeting the forest floor with trailing, “pine branch” stems – an ancient evergreen that reproduces by spores instead of flowers.",
    "desc": "Running Clubmoss is an intriguing relic of the Carboniferous age, often noticed as a **bright green, ground-hugging \"miniature pine\"** along trails. In the Howker Ridge area’s mixed forests, you’ll see it crawling over moss and humus, with prostrate stems several feet long that send up vertical shoots. The horizontal stems are slender (like green “cords”) that root at intervals, creating extensive mats. From these, upright **branchlets** rise 2–5 inches, looking like tiny fir trees or bottle-brushes. These upright shoots are densely covered in small, spirally-arranged leaves (microphylls) that are only a few millimeters long and narrow, giving a soft, feathery appearance. In summer, at the tips of some upright shoots you’ll spot 1–3 pale yellow **spore cones** (strobili), each about 1–2 inches long, resembling little club-like candles – hence names like \"Staghorn\" or \"Wolf’s-claw\" clubmoss. The plant’s texture is soft but wiry, and it stays green through winter under the snow. Running Clubmoss often forms large colonies in undisturbed woods, sometimes covering several square yards of forest floor like a green carpet. Its presence on Howker Ridge’s forest floor adds to the primeval, lush look of the understory.",
    "morph": "A creeping perennial vascular plant (though non-flowering) that resembles a moss but is actually a clubmoss (Lycophyte). It has two growth forms: long horizontal stems that run along the ground (up to 3+ feet long) and ascending lateral shoots that stand upright 5–15 cm (2–6 inches) tall. The horizontal stems are much-branched, rooting occasionally, and covered in tiny overlapping scale-like leaves ~3–5 mm long. The upright shoots also bear many small leaves arranged spirally around the stem, giving a bristly, “bushy” appearance. Toward the tips of some upright shoots, the leaves become modified into reproductive structures; here the plant produces **strobili** – cylindrical cones consisting of tightly packed, yellowish sporophylls (spore-bearing leaves). These spore cones are borne on slender stalks that rise above the foliage, often in pairs. The spores themselves are extremely fine, yellow dust-like particles produced in summer. (Historically these spores were known as lycopodium powder.) No true flowers or seeds are produced. The overall form of the plant is creeping and mat-forming; unlike true mosses, clubmoss has xylem/phloem (vascular tissue) and tends to have a tougher, more wiry feel. When dry, the plant can appear pale and brittle, but it quickly greens up with moisture.",
    "similar": "The forest floor of New Hampshire hosts a few similar **clubmosses** (also called ground-pines or ground-cedars). **Tree Clubmoss (Dendrolycopodium obscurum)**, often called Princess Pine, is upright (4–8 inches tall) and looks like a tiny evergreen tree, rather than having long running stems – it doesn’t form extensive prostrate runners like Running Clubmoss. **Shining Clubmoss (Huperzia lucidulum)** grows in clumps, not mats, with thicker unbranched spires and no strobili on stalks (its spore cases are in leaf axils). Running Clubmoss is unique in its combination of long creeping runners and upright, cone-tipped shoots. Superficially, patches of it might be mistaken for moss or even seedling conifers from a distance. It’s also sometimes confused with **Trailing Juniper (an actual conifer shrub)** when not closely observed, but juniper has woody stems and true scale-like foliage with berries, whereas clubmoss is soft and spore-bearing. Among non-experts, all clubmosses might look alike – however, Running Clubmoss’s **rope-like ground stems** and frequent yellow clubbed cones are a good giveaway.",
    "ecology": "Running Clubmoss is a survivor from an ancient lineage, and it fills a modest ecological niche in modern forests. As a groundcover in upland woods, it helps prevent erosion by carpeting the soil, especially on slopes or embankments. Its dense mats can suppress other small plants, which is one reason it often forms a singular layer in acidic, nutrient-poor soils where competition is limited. It prefers undisturbed sites – it often disappears from areas that are regularly trampled, farmed, or burned. The plant’s spores are highly flammable (once used as flash powder in old photography), but in nature the fine spores likely travel only short distances; the main spread is vegetative, creeping outward each year. Clubmoss provides minor cover for tiny forest floor fauna – salamanders or insects may hide under its runners. It is not a significant food source due to its high content of unpalatable compounds; deer or rodents generally avoid eating it. Interestingly, the sprawling mats can act as \"nurse plants\" by retaining moisture in their microhabitat, creating slightly cooler, damper conditions at ground level which might aid seedling survival of some trees or support mosses and fungi in their midst. Historically, humans have used Lycopodium powder (the spores) as a water-repellent dust (for medical gloves, etc.) and in magic tricks for fire effects, but these uses have diminished. Ecologically, Running Clubmoss is often a pioneer on the forest floor after glaciation or in new soils – but being slow-growing, it requires stable conditions. It often indicates an area of relatively long undisturbed ground. In sum, it’s a quiet presence – a living fossil that knits the forest floor together and reminds us of the primeval past.",
    "status": "Running Clubmoss is globally secure (G5) and abundant in New England forests. In the White Mountains it’s a familiar sight along trails and in pine or spruce-fir woods at mid elevations. It has no legal protection status in this region due to its commonness. However, in some parts of Europe (and a few U.S. states), related clubmosses have seen declines due to over-collection and habitat loss – clubmosses were once harvested extensively for holiday decorations (e.g., Christmas wreaths) and for their spores. Today, such practices are reduced, and in the White Mountains most populations are untouched and flourishing. The species is sensitive to heavy disturbance: frequent trampling or conversion of forest to pasture will eliminate it (it cannot survive plowing or high-traffic trails). But in protected forests of the WMNF, it is thriving. One notable aspect: clubmosses have slow reproductive cycles – their spores can take years to germinate in the soil (often needing a symbiotic fungus), so recovery from depletion is very slow. For that reason, some places discourage gathering clubmoss. In the UK, a similar clubmoss is listed as a priority conservation species due to rarity, but in our region Running Clubmoss remains common. Overall, as long as large tracts of forest remain intact, this ancient plant will continue creeping through our woodlands. Hikers can help by sticking to trails to avoid unnecessarily crushing the delicate “ferns of old.”"

    "desc": "Pincushion Moss is one of the most common and noticeable mosses in northern forests – often forming round, hummocky **cushions** that can range from a few inches to over a foot across. In the lush woods along Howker Ridge, you’ll see this moss as bright green, dome-shaped clumps nestled among tree roots or atop decaying logs. Each cushion is actually a dense colony of countless tiny moss plants. When well hydrated, the cushions appear vibrant green and plush; when dry, they can turn gray-green or almost whitish on the surface, crisping up until re-moistened. The texture is springy and spongy to the touch – stepping on a large patch feels like stepping on a cushion (hence the name). Pincushion Moss typically grows on acidic, well-drained substrates: the forest floor, old rotting stumps, boulder tops, etc., wherever moisture is available but not stagnant. Its mounds can be solitary or coalesce into a continuous carpet covering the ground. In the photos provided, these soft green mounds dot the ground beside lichens and clubmosses, creating a patchwork of textures. This moss is **acrocarpous** (growing in clumps and producing its spore capsules at the top of the cushion). Spore capsules are not always seen, but when present, they are tiny, stalked capsules emerging from the cushion, often reddish-brown, releasing spores that disperse by wind. Most reproduction, however, is clonal as the clump gradually expands outward. Pincushion Moss gives the forest a fairy-tale “moss garden” look, especially in areas with filtered light and ample humidity.",
    "morph": "A bryophyte (non-vascular plant) forming dense hemispherical clumps. Each clump comprises many individual **shoots** that grow tightly packed together. The shoots are upright, a few centimeters tall, and covered in overlapping leaves. The leaves of Pincushion Moss are lanceolate, about 4–7 mm long, and have a distinctive gray-green cast when dry (due to a whitish leaf base and cell structure). They are arranged around the stem, giving a star-like pattern if one looks at the top of a moist cushion (the shoot tips spread radially like the spokes of a tiny wheel). The moss lacks true roots, instead anchoring by rhizoids (fine filamentous structures) at the base of the shoots. As the colony ages, inner parts die and turn to a peat-like center, while new growth continues on the outside, contributing to the mound shape. The cushions can range from a couple inches across for younger colonies to over 2 feet across in very old ones. Color ranges from bright green on the cushion’s surface (especially when moist and photosynthesizing) to whitish or dull light green internally or when dry. If and when spore capsules form, they arise on slender setae (stalks) perhaps 1–2 cm tall, with a capsule that is cylindrical to ovoid and initially green, turning brown at maturity. These capsules have a lid (operculum) that pops off to release spores. However, Pincushion Moss doesn’t produce sporophytes frequently; it often spreads vegetatively as fragments of cushion establish elsewhere.",
    "similar": "Several other **cushion mosses** and bryophytes can look similar. **Dicranum (mood moss)** and **Leucobryum albidum** can also form cushiony patches, but Leucobryum glaucum typically forms larger, more uniform mounds and has that characteristic glaucous (blue-green) tint when dry. **Polytrichum (Haircap Moss)** can form mounds too, but it’s composed of taller, star-tipped stems and usually appears more coarse and bristly (and often with red-brown spore stalks sticking up). Haircap cushions also don’t have the same perfectly pillow-like shape and are less spongy. **Sphagnum moss** forms spongy carpets in bogs, but those are usually wet, flatter mats, and sphagnum has a very different “loose, bog cotton” texture. On dry logs, green algae or liverworts might be mistaken for young pincushion moss, but Pincushion Moss’s growth is more tufted and three-dimensional. Essentially, if you see a round, convex cushion of moss in a New Hampshire forest, Pincushion Moss is the top candidate. Its ability to turn whitish when dry (then green up when re-wetted) is another clue distinguishing it from consistently green moss species.",
    "ecology": "Pincushion Moss is an ecosystem engineer in miniature. By forming thick, cushiony mats, it helps **retain moisture** on the forest floor – the sponge-like colonies can absorb and hold significant amounts of water from rain and fog, slowly releasing it back to the environment and thereby moderating the microclimate. This water-holding capacity also means the moss can sustain itself through dry periods, rehydrating quickly when conditions improve. The cushions also trap falling debris (like pine needles and dust), contributing to soil formation underneath them over time. They often grow on thin soil or directly on rock surfaces where higher plants can’t establish, and by gradually accumulating organic matter, they prepare the site for other plants to eventually root – a classic pioneer role for mosses. Pincushion Moss clumps provide habitat for tiny soil invertebrates (springtails, mites, etc.) and shelter for nematodes and protists in the moist interior. Certain insects might lay eggs in the safe microenvironment of the cushions, and salamanders have been found nestled in mossy areas to keep moist. The moss itself primarily gains nutrients from rainwater, dust, and decaying matter caught in it. It can tolerate acidic conditions and even absorb some pollutants or metals from the environment, acting as a bioindicator of air quality (some studies note mosses accumulate heavy metals). In the White Mountains, its sheer commonality makes it a fundamental part of the forest ground cover – one reason the understory in many mature woods remains damp and spongy. Additionally, by covering exposed soil, Pincushion Moss helps reduce erosion on slopes during heavy rains. It’s also largely immune to browsing; few animals feed on moss in quantity. So, its ecological role is more about habitat creation, water regulation, and soil development than as part of the food web. All in all, Pincushion Moss quietly underpins the forest ecosystem, doing the slow work of building and protecting soil that taller plants will use.",
    "status": "As one of the most widespread mosses in eastern North America, Pincushion Moss is not at any risk. It is considered globally secure and is extremely common from the Appalachians through Canada and beyond. In the White Mountain National Forest, virtually any decent patch of mature woodland contains this moss. It faces no direct threats – even forest logging often leaves the ground and its moss layer intact if soil scarification is minimal. The main impact on Pincushion Moss would come from complete removal of tree cover (since it prefers shade and humidity), or severe pollution (sulfur dioxide and other pollutants historically harmed mosses in industrial areas). Luckily, the White Mountains enjoy relatively clean air, and this moss persists even near trails and campsites (though heavy trampling will damage it). If a cushion is destroyed (e.g., kicked apart), the moss can regenerate from fragments, but very large, old cushions (decades in the making) should be respected. Climate change scenarios that bring more intense droughts could temporarily desiccate Pincushion Moss – it survives drying by going dormant, but extended drought coupled with high heat could stress it or reduce its coverage in exposed spots. However, due to its broad range and adaptability, it’s expected to remain a dominant moss in our forests. No conservation programs target it (it’s far from rare), but its presence is an indicator of a healthy, undisturbed forest floor. In summary, Pincushion Moss is thriving and will continue to pillow the forests with its comforting green cushions for the foreseeable future."

    "teaser": "A tall, spiky moss that forms lush green carpets on damp forest floors – its upright stems topped with starry leaves and “hair-capped” spore capsules reaching for the sky.",
    "desc": "Common Haircap Moss is one of our largest mosses, creating miniature \"forests\" of its own on the ground. It grows in dense carpets or patches, often on damp, slightly acidic soil in woodlands. Along Howker Ridge, you might find it in seeps or near brook edges, where its 4-8 inch tall mats of **stiff, dark-green stems** stand out against lower mosses. Looking down at it, the plant shows a star-like arrangement of leaves at the tips of the stems – giving rise to another name, Star Moss. In the growing season, haircap moss is a vibrant green, and its colonies can cover logs, moist banks, or the bases of tree trunks. One striking feature comes when it reproduces: thin reddish stalks (setae) shoot up above the moss bed, each holding a brown spore capsule that is cylindric with a **tiny hairy cap (calyptra) on top** – hence “haircap.” These spore capsules, often appearing in late spring or summer, make the moss look like it’s dotted with a tiny upright matchsticks with fuzzy tips. The combination of height and distinctive reproductive structures makes haircap easy to identify. The underlayer of the moss clump consists of older, brown stems and a network of wiry rhizoids anchoring the colony. Haircap moss often colonizes bare, disturbed ground in forests – for example, after logging or fire, it can be an early colonizer due to its spores blowing in and germinating on raw soil. Over time, as leaf litter accumulates, it provides a substrate for seedlings of shrubs and trees to take root. This moss has a somewhat lustrous sheen, and water droplets often bead on its leaves after rain. When the sun hits a dewy patch of haircap moss in the morning, it’s a subtle but beautiful sight – like a miniature field of green stars covered in sparkling beads.",
    "morph": "A robust acrocarpous moss that forms vertical shoots in colonies. Each stem is typically 4–8 inches (10–20 cm) tall, making it one of the tallest mosses. The stems are unbranched and erect, with a thick covering of leaves along their length. Leaves are 6–12 mm long, narrow lanceolate with a sharp point, and arranged around the stem such that the top of each stem has a star-like rosette of spreading leaves (visible when moist). These leaves are somewhat rigid and have a glossy deep green color; they are toothed along the margins and have a distinctive midrib. When dry, the leaves clasp tight to the stem, and the moss appears brownish-green and shriveled; when rehydrated, the leaves spread outward again. Haircap moss is dioicous, meaning it has separate male and female shoots. Male shoots often have a “splash cup” of modified leaves at their tip that hold sperm – these may appear as tiny flower-like rosettes. Female shoots, after fertilization, produce **sporophytes**: a long reddish stalk (seta) up to 15 cm tall that holds a spore capsule. The capsule is elongated and angular (like a tiny pepper shaker) and is covered by a hairy cap (the calyptra) when young – this hairy cap looks like a little pointed hood. Eventually, the cap falls off, revealing a lid (operculum) and a ring of “teeth” that release spores. The spores are microscopic, wind-dispersed. Beneath the moss, the stems have multicellular rhizoids that anchor them to soil. Large colonies feel a bit like a coarse, upright turf and can have considerable thickness (the bottom part of stems die and turn to peat while new growth continues on top).",
    "similar": "Other **Polytrichum** species and large mosses resemble Common Haircap. **Polytrichum juniperinum (Juniper Haircap)** is smaller (2–4 inches) and often has a reddish stem tip and only one or few sporophytes per clump; its capsules are also more cylindrical and smaller. **Polytrichastrum (Polytrichum) ohioense** is another haircap moss found on logs, but tends to form smaller cushions and the capsules have different shapes. To the casual eye, haircap moss might be mistaken for tufts of grass or seedlings when not examined closely, due to its height and erect habit. However, grasses have jointed stems and roots and won’t have the distinctive star-like leaf arrangement. Some liverworts (e.g., Bazzania) can form mats in similar habitats, but those are creeping and much shorter. When sporophytes are present, haircap moss is unmistakable – no other common forest moss produces such tall stalks with hairy-capped capsules en masse. Also, if you pour water on a patch of haircap, the leaves spring open like a star – a quick way to differentiate it from other mosses that don’t have such large movement.",
    "ecology": "Haircap Moss often acts as a pioneer species on disturbed soil in woodlands and bog edges. Its spores can colonize bare acidic soil quickly, and the emerging moss mats then facilitate succession by collecting moisture and organic debris. This moss provides cover and moist microhabitat for many tiny creatures: springtails and other micro-arthropods are known to live within moss carpets, and salamanders or frogs in damp forests may use moss beds as hiding spots. Birds sometimes gather bits of moss (including haircap) to line their nests, taking advantage of its absorptive and insulating properties. Haircap Moss carpets are adept at retaining moisture – during rainfall, they soak up water like a sponge and then slowly release it, which helps maintain humidity at ground level and can reduce runoff. This contributes to the forest’s resilience in dry spells, as the moss will relinquish water to the environment as it dries. In nutrient-poor settings, haircap moss can also trap windblown particles and dust, incrementally improving soil fertility. The species is relatively tolerant of sun compared to many mosses, so it can survive in more open conditions until shaded competitors (like grasses or shrubs) overgrow it. It does prefer at least some shade and moisture – in fully sunny, dry sites it will not thrive. Interestingly, haircap moss and other Polytrichum have specialized internal tissue that conducts water (analogous to primitive vascular tissue), allowing them to grow taller than most mosses. Ecologically, this means haircap moss can outcompete shorter mosses for light in its niche. It’s one of the first mosses to colonize after fire in boreal regions, and helps stabilize the soil post-fire. In the White Mountains, you often see it at the edges of mountain bogs or wet ditches, where it forms a transition zone between aquatic sphagnum mats and the drier forest floor. Because it’s more tolerant of acidity, it often partners with blueberry bushes, rhododendrons, and other acid-loving plants in the understory. All told, haircap moss contributes significantly to water regulation, soil formation, and providing habitat complexity on the forest floor.",
    "status": "Globally and regionally, Common Haircap Moss is thriving. It’s found on every continent except Antarctica and is one of the most **widely distributed mosses** (hence “common” in its name). In New Hampshire, it is frequently encountered and not under any threat. It’s not a species of concern in any conservation list. In some localized scenarios, pollution (like acid rain) might have historically impacted moss growth, but haircap moss tends to handle acidic precipitation fine (it actually lives in naturally acidic settings). Heavy logging or development can temporarily remove it from a site, but it often re-establishes as soon as conditions allow – sometimes being even among the first to carpet a skid trail or stump dump after logging, helping recovery. Climate warming could alter its habitat a bit: if boreal bogs shrink, haircap mats at their edges might too, but conversely more frequent disturbances could give it new colonization opportunities. The species has even been used as an indicator of habitat quality; its presence suggests a relatively intact, moist forest floor. No harvesting pressure exists (though historically, dried haircap moss has been used as stuffing for bedding or insulation in some cultures, this is negligible now). In summary, haircap moss remains abundant from the lowest valleys to near alpine zones of the White Mountains. As long as forests remain, this resilient moss will continue to flourish. Efforts to maintain water quality and minimize pollution will only further ensure its well-being, but currently it shows no signs of decline."

    "teaser": "A whimsical lichen sprouting tiny trumpet-shaped cups from mossy logs and soil – as if a fairy left behind a set of little green goblets in the woods.",
    "desc": "Pixie-cup Lichen is a small lichen that often goes unnoticed until you crouch down and look closely at the forest floor. It forms a two-part structure: a base of crusty or scaly thallus on the substrate, and rising from that base are **miniature pale green cups** about 5–15 mm tall, resembling tiny goblets or trumpets. These cups (called podetia) have granular or powdery surfaces inside and out, giving them a frosted appearance. In the Howker Ridge Trail photos, you can see these pixie-cups colonizing a rotting log among mosses – they look like a little colony of golf tees standing upright. The color is a gray-green or sage green, which may turn more bluish when wet or more gray when dry. Sometimes the cups have a ragged edge or even small red dots if apothecia (fruiting bodies) of a different Cladonia are present, but Cladonia pyxidata typically has **“pebbled” cups without bright red tips** (the red-tipped ones are British Soldier lichens). The base of the lichen consists of small leaf-like lobes (squamules) that cling to the wood or soil. The overall look is otherworldly – like a tiny forest of chalices emerging from a bed of green algae and detritus. Pixie-cup lichen is a symbiosis of fungus and algae; it doesn’t have roots, instead it anchors loosely and absorbs water from its surroundings. This lichen can be common on decaying stumps, especially where moss is present to hold moisture. If you gently touch a patch, it feels brittle when dry and slightly springy when moist. Breaking a cup will reveal a dusty interior – those are its reproductive soredia or spores ready to disperse.",
    "morph": "A fruticose (branching) lichen that forms upright hollow tubes with flaring cup-shaped tops. The **podetia** (cup stalks) are 0.5–1.5 cm tall and 2–6 mm wide at the top, tapering toward the base. They are pale green-gray and covered in coarse granules (soredia) and often small scale-like areoles. The rim of each cup may be even or have a few small tooth-like lobules. The interior of the cup is typically granular as well. The base of the lichen (the primary thallus) consists of small, flat to somewhat curled lobes (about 2–4 mm across) that are gray-green on top and white below, pressed against the substrate. These basal squamules provide nourishment to the fungus via their algae and help attach the lichen. Pixie-cup lichen may produce sexual reproductive structures (apothecia), but in this species they are not showy – they would appear as tiny brown discs on the cup edges (often the cups remain sterile, reproducing mainly by soredia). The entire organism is fairly brittle; pieces can break off and form new colonies (a form of vegetative reproduction). The lichen’s cross-section (if you could slice the cup) shows distinct layers: an outer cortex, the algal layer beneath, and a medulla (fungal layer) inside – but these details require magnification. From above, especially when moist, the cups have a greenish cast due to the algae; in dry conditions, the lichen looks grayer. It’s often found intermingled with mosses, so it might have fragments of moss or organic matter stuck to it.",
    "similar": "Several Cladonia lichens share the \"pixie cup\" form. **Mealy Pixie-cup Lichen (Cladonia chlorophaea)** is a very similar species (often considered part of a species complex with C. pyxidata) – it has more powdery (mealy) cups with a finer granular surface and often slightly different chemistry, but to the naked eye they are nearly indistinguishable. **Cladonia pocillum** also has small cups but tends to have a more uniform, smoother cup interior. A key difference often used is microscopic or chemical tests, but visually one can lump many of these as \"pixie cup lichens.\" The **British Soldier Lichen (Cladonia cristatella)** is related and even starts with small cups, but quickly sports bright red cap-like apothecia on its branch tips, and its podetia are more cylindrical than cupped. **Trumpet Lichen (Cladonia fimbriata)** has very slender, trumpet-shaped cups with finely powdery surfaces – it’s another pixie cup lookalike but usually with narrower, more fragile cups. In the same habitat (rotting log), you might also see **Iceland moss lichen** or **reindeer lichen**, but those form bushy, coral-like mats, not cups. So basically, if you see tiny green-gray cups on wood or soil, you are looking at a Pixie-cup type lichen. Cladonia pyxidata is one of the common ones and is sometimes called \"Common Pixie-cup.\" It can be hard to differentiate from its close cousins without analysis, so they are often collectively referred to by that common name.",
    "ecology": "Pixie-cup Lichen contributes to the slow breakdown of wood and the creation of soil. Lichens like this can colonize bare wood or soil surfaces, and by secreting certain acids they help erode their substrate – for example, aiding in decaying a stump into soil over years. They also trap moisture and provide a foothold for other small organisms. These lichens are part of forest nutrient cycles: when they eventually die, they add organic matter and minerals (accumulated from rainfall and dust) to the soil. Pixie-cups often grow intermingled with mosses (as seen in the photos), and likely benefit from the moisture the moss holds. They, in turn, may protect the moss from drying out by shading the surface slightly. As a symbiotic organism, the alga in the lichen photosynthesizes and provides food for the fungus, while the fungus provides structure and protection – an arrangement that allows pixie-cup lichens to live in nutrient-poor niches. A few creatures utilize these lichens: some snails and slugs will graze on lichens including Cladonia (the soft tissues and algae are a source of nutrients), and certain mites or springtails might feed on the fungal or algal components. Lichen-feeding insects (like some Lepidoptera larvae) might occasionally include Cladonia in their diet, though pixie-cups are small. There are also specialized lichenicolous fungi (fungi that parasitize lichens) that can infect pixie-cup lichens, though this is not easily observed without a lens. In terms of succession, pixie-cup lichen is somewhat of a transitional colonizer – it often appears after mosses on a dead log and will flourish until the wood becomes too decomposed and soil accumulates, at which point higher plants or thicker moss might take over. Cladonias are also indicators of good air quality; they do not thrive in polluted air (sulfur dioxide, for instance, can kill them). So healthy populations of pixie-cup lichen in a forest suggest a relatively unpolluted environment. On a whimsical note, their fairy-goblet appearance has led to folklore that they are used by pixies or forest fairies for drinking cups, which, while fanciful, reflects the charm they add to the forest micro-landscape. They create a **miniature ecosystem** on each stump, complete with its own cycle of growth and decay, contributing to the forest’s diversity at a tiny scale.",
    "status": "Pixie-cup lichens are common and widespread across the Northern Hemisphere. Cladonia pyxidata (and its close relatives in the pixie-cup complex) are considered globally secure (G5). In New Hampshire and the White Mountains, they are frequently found in appropriate habitats – any decaying log in a moist forest might host them. There are no known threats specific to this species; their health is tied largely to air quality and habitat availability. As long as forests with rotting wood exist and the air remains relatively clean, pixie-cup lichens will persist. They are not subject to collection pressure (occasionally hobbyists or educators might gather a piece to show students, but this has negligible impact). Environmental changes that could affect them include severe air pollution or drastic changes in forest moisture (e.g., extreme droughts may cause local die-back, but lichens can often rebound or survive dormant). Because they rely on a stable partnership between fungus and alga, they are sensitive to disruptions like acidic pollution or heavy metals, which can damage the algal cells. Historically, industrial pollution in parts of Europe caused declines in sensitive lichens, but the White Mountains, being largely rural, haven’t seen such lichen losses. Indeed, pixie-cup lichens are still flourishing on logs from valley floors up to subalpine elevations (though in alpine areas the Cladonia genus tends to form reindeer lichens rather than cups). Conservation-wise, they don’t require direct intervention; protecting forest habitats and maintaining air quality suffices. They serve as reminders of the importance of **Leave No Trace** – a heavy boot scrape on a mossy log can obliterate decades of slow lichen growth in an instant. However, given time and good conditions, they’ll recolonize. In summary, pixie-cup lichens are not endangered or rare; they are small but resilient denizens of the forest, continuing their quiet work of turning wood into soil, one tiny cup at a time."

    "desc": "British Soldier Lichen is perhaps the most eye-catching lichen in our forests due to its striking color contrast. It forms small colonies of upright, branched **pale green stalks (podetia) topped with vivid red caps** – the red being the lichen’s spore-producing structures (apothecia). The whole lichen stands only about 0.5–1 inch tall, but the neon red dots on the tips are visible against the subdued tones of logs and moss. On Howker Ridge Trail, you might spot these on decaying wood or soil at trail edges, especially in a spot with a bit of sun filtering through. The main body of the lichen (the podetia) is green-gray and can be somewhat irregular, sometimes branching like a tiny coral or shrub. The surface of the stalks is roughened with a dusting of soredia and tiny scales. At the tip of each branch, when mature, sits a scarlet red cup or knob – these red parts are what gave the lichen its common name, as they reminded observers of the red coats worn by British soldiers in the Revolutionary War. A patch of British Soldier Lichen looks almost like a cluster of matchsticks, green stems with red heads. They often grow amidst other lichens and mosses on an old stump. In one provided photo, for example, you can see their red caps poking above a bed of emerald moss. Because lichens are a symbiosis of fungus and algae, the greenish tinge of the stalks is due to the algae within, which perform photosynthesis. Touching the lichen is generally dry and brittle, and the red caps can rub off, leaving a stain. British Soldier Lichen doesn’t have roots – it anchors superficially. It tends to grow in places that are a bit sheltered from direct rain and wind (e.g., the side of a log), as it likes some protection. The brilliance of the red is especially apparent in winter or early spring, when the forest colors are dull – little red specks stand out on the brown background.",
    "morph": "A fruticose lichen forming erect, cylindrical to somewhat branched stalks (podetia) up to about 10–15 mm tall. The podetia are grayish to greenish and have a granular surface with tiny flake-like areoles. They may branch irregularly or stand unbranched with a single tip. Atop many of the podetia, **bright red apothecia** are present as round, knob-like discs or caps (1–3 mm across). Some tips have one red cap; others can have 2–3 clustered, giving a candelabra look. If no apothecium is present, the tip may be pointed or cup-like, but Cladonia cristatella often shows red on most mature stalks – in fact, it commonly sports an apothecium on nearly every branch. The base of the lichen consists of a crusty or squamulose primary thallus (similar to pixie-cup lichen’s base) that is usually not as noticeable once the podetia grow. The tissue of the podetia is solid (not hollow like some pixie-cups) and has an inner cottony white medulla. The red apothecia are the fruiting bodies where the fungal partner produces spores. These spores (by themselves) can disperse, but without the algae, they must land near a suitable algal partner to form a new lichen, which is a rare event – hence British Soldier mainly spreads by fragments or soredia containing both partners. The overall shape of a colony is a tuft or scattered cluster of these green-gray stems with red dots. It often co-occurs with other Cladonia species, but its red caps set it apart. Under magnification, one can see tiny cup-like hollows in the red apothecia where spores are released. The name “cristatella” means crested, referring to these tufted red caps on the crest of the stalk. This lichen’s structure is relatively delicate – the red tops can be knocked off and the stalks broken by a careless hand or foot.",
    "similar": "The defining feature of British Soldier Lichen is its red apothecia on green-gray stalks. A few other lichens have similar red fruiting bodies: **Cladonia floerkeana** (often called the *Soldier Lichen* as well in Europe) has red caps but typically on slender, more consistently cup-tipped stalks, and is less common in our area. **Cladonia coccifera** (Red-fruited Pixie Cup) has red apothecia but perched on cup-shaped podetia. Many of these are hard to tell apart without close examination, but generally C. cristatella in our region is characterized by not having large cups, just branching stalks with red dots. **Pixie-cup Lichens** (Cladonia pyxidata complex) have no red – only green-gray cups (discussed above). **Wolf’s Milk Slime (Lycogala epidendrum)**, a slime mold, sometimes produces pinkish-red blobs on logs that might superficially catch the eye, but those are spherical pink/orange blobs of goo, not on stalks and not connected to a lichen body. It’s unlikely to confuse British Soldiers with anything else if one notes the combination of upright lichen and red tips. People sometimes mistake them for tiny “flowers” or “berries” on moss to the naked eye, but they are neither – the red is part of the lichen itself. Because British Soldier often grows intermingled with other lichens, one might see pale gray Cladonia and assume the red belongs to them. However, on careful inspection you see the red tops are attached to the same stalks – confirming it’s a Cladonia with red apothecia. So, in summary: any small cup-less lichen with red tips in Eastern forests is likely this species. The common name gets plural “lichens” because they often appear in groups, like a squad of soldiers. In fact, one stump can host hundreds of these little red-capped figures, making a truly distinctive scene.",
    "ecology": "British Soldier Lichen shares a similar ecological role with other reindeer and Cladonia lichens but in more mesic, sheltered microhabitats. It typically grows where it has partial protection – e.g., the side of a decaying log facing away from prevailing winds, or at the base of a tree – which suggests it doesn’t thrive in extreme exposure. By growing on decaying wood and soil, it contributes to **decomposition** and soil formation. Like pixie-cups, it secretes lichen acids that break down wood fibers and even mineral particles. It also competes with mosses: sometimes you’ll see it poking out of a moss carpet; it benefits if the moss is low-growing so that it can still get sun on its algae. Lichens including British Soldiers are pioneers on bare, poor substrates – they can colonize nutrient-poor sand or rotting stumps where vascular plants struggle. They absorb everything they need from rain, fog, and dust (which includes nutrients like nitrogen or calcium in minute amounts). One interesting aspect is their sensitivity to air quality: Cladonia cristatella will die off if air pollution (sulfur dioxide, ozone, heavy metals) is too high, making it an indicator species for clean, unpolluted forests, much like many lichens. In terms of food web, few animals eat British Soldier Lichen because of the acids and low nutritional value, though some species of snails have been recorded feeding on Cladonia. The lichen’s presence does offer a tiny vantage or display ground for micro-fauna; for example, certain springtails might use lichen stalks as perches to launch themselves. Also, hummingbirds and some songbirds have been known to incorporate lichens into their nests as camouflage or binding material – they prefer filamentous lichens (like old man’s beard), but occasionally tufted lichens may be picked off and used. It’s not documented specifically for this species, but any lichen on a branch could become nest decor. British Soldiers reproduce a lot by spores (as evidenced by many apothecia), but since those spores need to find algae, the more reliable reproduction is when a chunk breaks off containing both partners. Heavy rain or animals brushing against it can fragment the lichen and scatter pieces which can re-establish elsewhere. Over decades, British Soldier Lichen can colonize a series of stumps in a clearing, flourish, and then as those stumps fully rot and are overgrown by shrubs, the lichen’s cycle ends in that spot – it is outcompeted and shaded out by higher plants. However, in a healthy mosaic of forest gaps, there will always be new logs and soil patches opening up for it to colonize, maintaining its presence in the ecosystem. As such, it plays a dynamic role in forest regeneration: one of the first to adorn a fresh log or soil mound, making the most of the gap until bigger life-forms take over. Its bright red tops might even serve as a visual lure for some insects (certain red aphids or mites might be drawn to them, for instance), but more research would be needed. At the very least, they serve as a delightful visual for human observers, adding aesthetic value to the forest floor – which in a broad sense fosters human appreciation for conserving such habitats.",
    "status": "British Soldier Lichen is **common and secure** in its range (eastern North America). It has no special conservation status – indeed, it’s often one of the first lichens people learn because of its abundance and bright color. In the White Mountains, it can be found from valley forests up into subalpine zones anywhere decaying wood and partial sunlight coincide. It’s not rare or declining; on the contrary, whenever new wood is made available (from storms, logging, die-off), these lichens tend to colonize if conditions suit. They may take a couple of years to show up on a fresh stump (first the base crust forms, then podetia grow and red caps appear), but within a decade or so after a tree falls, you often see them. Their presence can diminish in later stages of decay as mosses and higher plants cover the substrate, but regionally there’s always new habitat cropping up. Air pollution is a broad factor – historically, heavily industrialized regions saw declines in colorful Cladonia lichens. In the relatively clean air of northern New England, that’s not a problem. Climate change isn’t expected to directly harm this species; it tolerates a range of temperatures. Possibly, more intense precipitation patterns could physically wash away delicate lichen colonies or more frequent droughts could stress them. However, Cladonia cristatella is quite resilient in bouncing back after unfavorable spells; it essentially waits in a dormant state during drought and resumes growth in moisture. There is no commercial harvest of this lichen (sometimes hobbyists collect a bit for terrariums or school projects due to its cute appearance, but that’s negligible). In some protected natural areas, one might caution not to pick or trample lichens so they remain for others to enjoy and for their ecological roles, but overall British Soldier is not at risk. It benefits from general forest conservation – as long as there are undisturbed or semi-disturbed woods, this lichen will have its niche. Thus, the outlook for British Soldier Lichen is bright (as bright as its apothecia): it remains a secure, flourishing species – a little soldier holding the fort in our forests, so to speak. Its only “enemies” are large-scale environmental degradation, which currently are kept at bay in the well-protected White Mountain landscapes."

    "teaser": "A pale gray, branching lichen that forms crunchy mats over alpine rocks and barrens – famously known as \"reindeer moss\" and vital in arctic ecosystems.",
    "desc": "Reindeer Lichen is the bleach-gray, coral-like lichen crunching underfoot on many exposed ridges. In the Presidential Range alpine, it forms extensive mats on windswept, rocky ground, often alongside other cushion plants and sedges. Its growth is shrubby and intricate: a tufted thicket of finely branching fronds (podetia) that have a somewhat wiry yet brittle texture. The lichen is a pale greenish-gray (sometimes with a yellow or bluish tint when wet), and individual clumps can be the size of a dinner plate or larger, though typically you see many small clumps merging. Along Howker Ridge below 2500 ft, you might find pockets of reindeer lichen in open pine or spruce glades where the forest floor is sandy and sunny – though it’s more dominant at higher elevations. The structure looks almost like tiny leafless trees or a piece of sponge: branches repeatedly fork in a channeled (hollow) pattern, with pointed tips. No distinct “fruiting bodies” are obvious; instead, the whole branch system can produce spores from small areas on the branch surfaces. Reindeer lichen is very slow-growing – only a few millimeters per year – and can live for decades, gradually expanding its range in favorable spots. It’s named for being a principal food of reindeer and caribou in subarctic regions. When you touch it dry, it’s crisp and can crumble; when moist, it becomes more pliant. This lichen has no roots; it sits loosely on the ground, which is why you often see it in undisturbed sites (footsteps can displace or destroy it). It often is the last life-form in places that are too harsh for most plants – e.g., thin soils on granite or in frost pockets. Its presence lends a silvery cast to the landscape, especially striking in alpine tundra where it can cover large swaths and reflect sunlight like a pale carpet.",
    "morph": "A fruticose (shrubby) lichen forming dense branching clumps 2–10 cm tall. The branches (podetia) are hollow and round, with a dry, cartilaginous feel. They are repeatedly branched in a somewhat dichotomous manner (forking into two, then four, etc.), giving a **bushy, coral-like appearance**. Branch surfaces are matte and covered with tiny white powder (soredia) in places; they lack any leafy structures. Color is usually a uniform whitish-gray, sometimes with pale green or yellow tones. There is no distinct differentiated “leaf” or “stem” in this lichen – the whole thallus is a continuous network of tubes. Reproductive structures (apothecia) are not commonly seen or are not conspicuous on C. rangiferina; it mainly propagates by fragmentation (bits breaking off and re-establishing). Underneath a patch, you won’t find roots, but you might find a thin layer of white fungal threads that once attached to substrate – however, reindeer lichen essentially just rests on the ground. If you pick up a clump, it comes off like a piece of dried sponge. It often grows intertwined with other Cladonia lichens; for example, similar species like Cladonia portentosa or C. arbuscula can be mixed in, which look very alike except under magnification (even experts have trouble differentiating them in the field; chemical tests are sometimes used). A single clump often has a roundish outline with a mounded center tapering to edges. Because of its slow growth, older parts in the center of a mat may die off (turning a dull yellow-brown, brittle and collapsing to powdery detritus) while newer growth is around the periphery. Patches can merge into a continuous cover. It’s truly a “cushion plant” of the lichen world, but unlike green cushion mosses, it has a stiff structure. In wet weather, it soaks up water and becomes a bit translucent and soft; in dry weather it is crispy and pale. The stark look of reindeer lichen is an adaptation – by being light-colored, it reflects intense alpine sunlight, keeping the lichen from overheating and preventing UV damage.",
    "similar": "Several **Cladonia** lichens form similar gray, branching mats. **Cladonia stellaris** (Star-tipped Reindeer Lichen) forms more rounded, ball-like cushions with a denser branching pattern – it sometimes grows alongside C. rangiferina and is slightly greener and more cushiony. **Cladonia mitis** and **Cladonia arbuscula** are also very similar; in fact, hikers usually just call all these gray lichens \"reindeer moss.\" Differentiating them requires close examination of branching angles or chemical spot tests. From a practical standpoint, all these reindeer lichens share similar ecology and appearance, and often intermix. **Iceland Moss** (which is actually a lichen, Cetraria islandica) is darker brown and has broader, leaf-like lobes, so it’s not easily confused. **Sphagnum moss** might at a glance look like a pale mat in alpine bogs, but sphagnum has a softer, wet feel and a green or red hue, plus is confined to wet areas. Reindeer lichens, by contrast, are in dry, open spots. **Cup lichens (Cladonia)** we discussed (pixie cups) are lower and have cup shapes, no confusion there. Sometimes people confuse reindeer lichen with patches of dried gray moss or even with desiccated shrubs, but once you see the fine branching up close, you know it’s a lichen. If one lichen patch has some bits with red tips (apothecia), that’s likely a stray British Soldier or related Cladonia mixed in – reindeer lichen itself never has red tips. It’s worth noting that hikers not familiar with it may call it \"coral moss\" or \"gray moss\" but it’s not a moss. **Dead heather or small twigs** can superficially look like gray sticks on the ground, but they’re woody and not springy like lichen. So, in summary: any extensive mat of gray, brittle, bushy growth on the ground in an open mountain or barren area is likely reindeer lichen (Cladonia group). The exact species might be a mix, but their differences are minor ecologically.",
    "ecology": "Reindeer Lichen is a **pioneer species in harsh, barren landscapes**. It can colonize bare rock or mineral soil, secreting acids that slowly help break down rock into soil – thus facilitating later plant succession. It has no roots; it absorbs water and nutrients from rain and air across its surface, which means it’s very sensitive to air quality (sulfates or smog can kill it). In alpine and subalpine zones, its mats help retain a bit of moisture and reduce erosion by covering soil. It grows extremely slowly (only a few millimeters per year) and can take decades to recover after disturbance. This lichen provides critical winter food for caribou/reindeer in subarctic regions, though in NH the woodland caribou are long gone. Still, micro-fauna like insects or spiders may use its tangle for shelter, and birds sometimes pick lichen for nest lining. Its presence on White Mountain summits links these peaks to far northern tundra ecosystems. Because it is so slow-growing, trampling by hikers can eliminate it from heavily used alpine trail edges – hence the importance of walking carefully on rocks where possible. Globally, Cladonia rangiferina is common (NatureServe “Secure”), but locally it benefits from alpine zone conservation efforts.",
    "status": "Not rare – in fact quite common in alpine and barren habitats across the Northern Hemisphere. In the White Mountains it forms an integral part of the alpine community and lower-elevation pine barrens. It has no special protection status, though it is indirectly protected as part of conserved natural communities. The main concern is its vulnerability to damage: a footprint can crush centuries of growth. Therefore, land managers emphasize Leave No Trace principles in lichen-rich areas. Air pollution historically reduced lichen abundance in some industrial regions; relatively clean mountain air has allowed reindeer lichen to flourish here. Overall, this species is holding steady, but it reminds us that alpine life can be both hardy and fragile – hardy in surviving cold and drought, yet fragile against human impact."

    "desc": "A common perennial fern of Eastern forests, named because its dark green fronds often persist through winter snows. Growing in vase-like clumps, Christmas Fern hugs the forest floor on hillsides and stream banks, where its tough, lance-shaped fronds provide year-round ground cover. Each leaflet has a tiny lobe shaped like a holiday stocking, a quirky trait that helps identify this species. This hardy fern thrives in humus-rich, well-drained soil and helps stabilize slopes with its fibrous rhizomes. While unassuming, it’s an important evergreen element of the understory, offering shelter to small creatures even in cold months.",
    "morph": "Forms clumps of arching fronds up to 1–2 feet long. Fronds are once-pinnate (single series of leaflets) and leathery in texture. Each pinna (leaflet) is about 1–2 inches long with a finely toothed margin and an ear-like lobe (auricle) at the base on the upper side. New fronds unfurl as silvery \"fiddleheads\" in spring and mature to glossy deep green. The fertile fronds have sporangia (spore cases) on the undersides of the upper pinnae, appearing as rusty-brown patches when spores mature. Fronds remain green through winter, lying flat under snow and then standing back up in spring.",
    "similar": "Other woodland ferns like *Marginal Wood Fern* (*Dryopteris marginalis*) are also evergreen and may grow nearby, but marginal wood fern has more finely divided fronds without the distinctive stocking-shaped pinnae, and its spore clusters sit along the leaflet margins. *Intermediate Wood Fern* (*Dryopteris intermedia*) is deciduous and twice-cut (feathery fronds). Christmas Fern’s combination of once-divided, leathery fronds with auricled leaflets sets it apart. Its evergreen habit (green fronds in winter) is a key clue – few other ferns in its habitat stay green year-round.",
    "ecology": "An evergreen anchor of the eastern forest floor. Clumping rhizomes and persistent fronds hold leaf litter in place and curb erosion on slopes and ravine banks. The year-round cover shelters ground beetles, spiders, and salamanders; in winter it provides rare green structure in a largely dormant understory. As fronds senesce, they add durable carbon to the duff, building rich humus that benefits spring ephemerals and tree seedlings.",
    "status": "Very common and not of conservation concern. Christmas Fern is widespread throughout eastern North America and thrives in a variety of woodland settings. Its resilience – including tolerance of winter cold and deer avoidance (the firm fronds are not a favorite browse) – means it often remains abundant even in areas where other plants are grazed or habitat is disturbed. No special protection is needed for this species, as it readily repopulates shaded slopes and can even be used in forest restoration plantings. Maintaining healthy forests naturally ensures this familiar fern will continue to flourish under the trees."

    "desc": "This conspicuous lichen – also called Tree Lungwort or Lung Lichen – forms broad, lettuce-like patches on the trunks of old trees. In damp forests with pristine air, you’ll see its green lobes hanging from bark or carpeting shaded rocks. The thallus can be extensive (several inches across), bright green when wet and turning grayish when dry, with a surface full of ridges and wrinkles reminiscent of lung tissue. Lobaria pulmonaria is famed as an indicator of healthy, mature forests: it thrives where humidity is high and the air is clean, often in stands of old hardwoods or spruce-fir. Historically, people noticed its lung-like appearance and used it as a folk remedy for respiratory ailments. In the ecosystem, this lichen quietly toils – capturing sunlight with its green algae, fixing nitrogen with its cyanobacteria, and enriching the forest when pieces fall to the ground. Finding a thriving patch of lungwort lichen in the woods is a sign you’re standing in an ancient, unpolluted forest enclave.",
    "morph": "A foliose (leaf-like) lichen with large, lobed thalli. Each thallus is comprised of broad, overlapping lobes that are 2–5 inches long, irregularly shaped and crinkled. The upper surface is green to olive (bright green when moist), with a network of ridges, folds, and wart-like bumps; the underside is pale whitish to tan, often with fuzzy patches of whitish fungus and some areas harboring blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) visible as darker patches. Rather than discrete leaves, the entire structure is a single lichen body attached at various points to the substrate. It often hangs in floppy sheets or broad scalloped rosettes from bark. Tiny granular structures called soredia (containing both fungus and algae) form along ridges on the surface – these serve as the primary reproductive propagules, rubbing off to start new lichens elsewhere. Apothecia (disk-like spore-producing bodies) are infrequent on lungwort; when present, they appear as small reddish-brown disks on the lichen’s surface, but reproduction is mostly vegetative. The texture of the lichen is pliable and rubbery when damp, but it becomes crisp and brittle when dry.",
    "similar": "Other foliose lichens can grow on tree bark, but *Lungwort Lichen* is distinctive for its size and color. *Lobaria quercizans* (Oak Lungwort) and *Lobaria scrobiculata* are related species occasionally found in similar habitats – they also have large green lobes, but are less common and have different surface textures (for instance, L. quercizans has a smoother surface with white patches beneath). More common bark lichens like *Parmelia* (shield lichens) or *Flavoparmelia* are much smaller, forming thinner leafy rosettes just a few inches wide, and lack the thick, corrugated lobes and bright green wet color of Lobaria. One could mistake a patch of lungwort lichen for a moss from a distance (due to its green hue), but up close the lobed, leafy structure and absence of stems makes clear it’s a lichen. Its three-part symbiosis (fungus, green alga, and cyanobacteria) is also unusual – many other lichens have only a two-part partnership.",
    "ecology": "A large foliose epiphyte of humid, old-growth woods (Lobaria pulmonaria) that materially enriches nutrient cycles. Housing both green algae and nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in its thallus, it adds bioavailable nitrogen to bark and throughfall, fertilizing the moss–lichen layer and the soil below. Broad, water-holding lobes intercept cloud moisture and moderate bark microclimate while providing forage for gastropods and nest material/camouflage for birds. Extremely sensitive to air pollution, bark desiccation, and canopy fragmentation; healthy mats signal clean air and long forest continuity. Disperses mainly by soredia/isidia, so recovery is slow where populations are lost.",
    "status": "Regionally, Lungwort Lichen is an uncommon but significant species. It is not globally rare – it has a broad circumboreal range – but it has declined in areas with air pollution or loss of old-growth habitat. In some parts of Europe it’s become scarce (even legally protected) due to sensitivity to sulfur dioxide and forest clearing. In New England, it persists in pockets of mature forest; in New Hampshire it’s considered an indicator of high-quality woodland but not listed as endangered. As long as clean air and damp, shaded woods are available, this lichen can flourish and even form extensive colonies on favorable trees. Conservation of older forests and good air quality indirectly benefit it. While not at immediate risk in the White Mountains region (where many forests are protected and air is relatively clean), Lungwort Lichen reminds us of the value of intact ecosystems – its presence is a reassuring sign of environmental health. It has no special conservation status here, but its sensitivity makes it a natural barometer of forest air purity and continuity."

This fruticose (shrubby) lichen hangs in trailing tufts several inches long, often from twigs and bark in the lower canopy. Soft and elastic, it sways with the slightest breeze, giving old woods a mystical, bearded appearance. Where you find Usnea in abundance, you can bet the air is clean – this lichen is extremely sensitive to pollution and flourishes only in healthy environments. Beyond its ecological role as an indicator, Old Man’s Beard has a storied past in folk medicine: long ago it was gathered as an antiseptic bandage and remedy for coughs due to its potent anti-microbial compounds. In the forest, though, it simply lives quietly on bark, absorbing moisture from fog and rain and getting nutrients from the air. Its presence lends an ancient character to the woods, as if the trees themselves grew beards over time.",
    "morph": "A fruticose lichen that forms tufted, dangling masses of fine, branching filaments. Each \"strand\" of Usnea is a thallus consisting of a tough, thin outer layer that is pale yellow-green (thanks to symbiotic algae) and a central core of white, elastic fibers. This inner core is unique – if you gently pull a strand, the outer cortex will break but a stretchy white thread inside is revealed, a key ID feature of the genus. The branches are irregularly forked, often with tiny side branchlets, and may carry small, powdery soredia on their surface (these are reproductive granules that can rub off to start new lichens). Old Man’s Beard typically has no large fruiting bodies visible to the naked eye; occasionally it produces minute reddish or pale disk-like apothecia on the tips of branches, but reproduction is mainly by pieces breaking off and dispersing. The texture is slightly coarse to the touch (not slimy or smooth). Color ranges from light green to gray-green, and unlike Spanish moss (a flowering plant it’s sometimes mistaken for in appearance), this lichen’s strands are relatively short in northern climates (a few inches long, not feet). It lacks leaves or obvious structures other than the branching, hair-like thallus.",
    "similar": "Several other tree-dwelling lichens hang from branches, but Usnea’s combination of pale green coloration and an elastic central cord sets it apart. *Witch’s Hair Lichen* (*Alectoria sarmentosa*), for example, is also stringy and hangs from trees in moist forests, but it tends to be more yellowish chartreuse in color and does not have the white stretchy core (its strands snap more cleanly). *Horsehair Lichen* (*Bryoria* species) drapes from trees in long tresses too, but those are dark brown to black in color, resembling tail hair. Green \"stringy\" lichens like *Ramalina* or *Evernia* are usually shorter and flatter in form (and Evernia, or Oakmoss, has a different, branching-flat appearance). One could also confuse Old Man’s Beard with Spanish Moss at a glance, but Spanish Moss is a flowering plant of warmer climates and isn’t found in New England forests. In short, if you see gently dangling, light green lichen strands on a northern forest tree and they stretch when pulled, you’re looking at an Usnea.",
    "ecology": "A long-lived, slow-growing epiphyte that hangs from spruce and fir branches, intercepting cloud moisture and fog and releasing it drip-by-drip to the understory. The wiry thalli host diverse micro-fauna and are used by songbirds as nest lining and camouflage. Highly sensitive to air pollution and chronic drying, so robust tufts indicate clean, humid air. When storms shed branches, the fallen lichens decompose and contribute trace nutrients to otherwise nutrient-poor forest floors.",
    "status": "Old Man’s Beard lichens are not rare globally – there are many Usnea species found in forests around the world – but they are very sensitive to environmental conditions. In regions with severe air pollution or heavy deforestation, they decline or disappear, which historically happened in parts of Europe (where some Usnea are now protected). In the White Mountains and broader New Hampshire woodlands, Usnea is still relatively common in clean, damp areas and has no legal protection status. Its abundance in an area is a good sign of air quality and forest continuity. Because it relies on mature trees and takes time to grow, it can suffer when old forests are logged. Generally, however, as long as large tracts of forest remain and the air stays unpolluted, this lichen will continue to grace the trees. It’s a resilient survivor of pristine habitats – a natural air filter and a silent witness to the purity of its surroundings."

White Cushion Moss (also called White Moss) often covers the tops of rocks or old stumps in shady woods, forming spongy, domed cushions that can be a foot or more across. In wet weather the cushions turn a vibrant green, and in dry spells they become pale, almost whitish on the surface – a distinctive color change that gives the moss its name. Underneath that soft surface, countless tiny moss stems are packed densely together. These cushions act like natural sponges, soaking up rainwater and providing a miniature reservoir of moisture in the ecosystem. Touching one feels springy and cool (though it’s best to admire without squishing them too much). Common across New England, this species is often the first to colonize a bare, damp spot, eventually creating thick mats that other plants and tiny creatures can inhabit. It’s a humble yet important part of the forest tapestry, holding soil in place and retaining water on the woodland floor.",
    "morph": "Forms dense, hemispherical cushions that range from softball-size to over a foot wide and several inches high. Each cushion is composed of a tight clump of upright moss shoots. The individual moss plants are slender and only a few centimeters tall, with many overlapping leaves that are lance-shaped and pointed at the tip. These leaves have a whitish cast when dry (due to internal cells that reflect light), giving the cushion a silvery-gray hue in drought, but they turn deep green when rehydrated. The growth is acrocarpous (upright clump-forming), so new shoots keep building on the old, expanding the cushion outward. The moss lacks true roots, attaching to soil or wood via tiny filaments (rhizoids) at the cushion’s base. Occasionally, especially after wet periods, you may see a multitude of thin, wiry stalks (setae) emerging from the cushion, each bearing a small brown capsule at its tip – these are the spore capsules (sporangia). When the capsules ripen and dry, they release spores through a tiny lid, continuing the moss’s life cycle. Most of the time, though, cushions reproduce by fragmentation, as bits of moss break off and start new colonies nearby.",
    "similar": "No other moss in our forests forms such perfectly rounded, pillow-like mounds, so White Cushion Moss is fairly easy to recognize. *Dicranum* species (like *Rock Cap Moss*) can form thick mats on boulders, but those mats are more shaggy or carpet-like rather than a tidy cushion, and they stay darker green. Sphagnum hummocks in bogs might superficially resemble cushion moss, but sphagnum is usually wetter, more peaty, and often shows reddish or orange tints; plus, sphagnum sinks underfoot whereas cushion moss mounds are firm. Another genus, *Leucobryum albidum*, is very similar to L. glaucum and also makes small cushions – in practice, even botanists lump them together in the field, since both create the same cushiony patches (they differ in microscopic details). For a casual observer, if you see a neat, round cushion of moss that turns whitish when dry, you can confidently call it cushion moss. Its combination of shape and color shift is unique among common mosses.",
    "ecology": "A mound-forming forest moss (Leucobryum glaucum) that functions like a living sponge. Its dense cushions store rain and fog drip, then release moisture slowly, buffering the forest floor against drying and temperature swings. The hummocks trap needles, dust, and mineral particles, accelerating humus formation on rocks, stumps, and thin soils and creating germination sites for tree seedlings, fungi, and other bryophytes. Cushions shelter micro-fauna (springtails, mites, nematodes) and small amphibians. Highly susceptible to crushing—heavy trampling collapses decades of growth—so intact, pale cushions indicate undisturbed, acidic, shady woodlands with relatively clean air.",
    "status": "Widespread and abundant, White Cushion Moss has no conservation concerns. It is a successful colonizer of damp forest soils from the Appalachians to boreal Canada, often appearing soon after disturbances to carpet the ground. Because it tolerates a range of conditions – from soggy streambanks to relatively dry ridge woods (going dormant in drought) – it remains common across its range. In some areas it’s even harvested for the nursery trade or used in terrariums and gardening, though in the wild it regenerates easily where it’s removed. Maintaining forest habitats naturally supports this moss, but it doesn’t require any special protection. Its role in the ecosystem as a moisture-holder and soil stabilizer is appreciated but not threatened. In short, those soft green pillows will continue dotting our forest floors wherever shade and moisture coincide."

    "teaser": "A tall, elegant forest grass with loose, nodding seed heads that dangle in airy clusters – giving shaded streambanks a graceful, drooping accent.",
    "desc": "Drooping Woodreed is a native woodland grass that brings a touch of grace to the forest understory. It grows in small clumps in wet hollows and along forested stream edges, reaching heights of 3–5 feet under favorable conditions. The stems bear broad green blades, but the real show comes in summer when the plant unveils a long, delicate inflorescence that arches outward and downward. This inflorescence is an open panicle of many slender branches, each holding tiny greenish or purplish spikelets that hang like miniature ornaments. The entire seed head has a drooping, oat-like appearance, swaying gently with the humid summer breeze. In the dim light of a deep woods, these dangling panicles catch what sun filters through, appearing almost soft-focused and hazy. Drooping Woodreed thrives in nutrient-rich, damp soil and often goes unnoticed until it blooms – suddenly revealing that even grasses can be woodland wildflowers. It plays an understated role, adding texture and movement to mossy, dark forests where few other tall grasses can compete.",
    "morph": "A perennial grass that grows in loose tufts from short rhizomes. Culms (stems) are erect to arcing, typically 2–4 feet tall (and occasionally up to ~6 feet in very lush sites), with a few broad leaves (up to 1 cm wide) that are limp and often hairy near the base. The crown of the plant produces an inflorescence that is a large, open panicle 6–18 inches long. The panicle’s branches are thin and wiry, spreading outward and then drooping, giving a cascading effect. Each branch bears several small spikelets (each spikelet about 3–4 mm long) that are green with a hint of purple or tawny brown as they mature. Each spikelet usually contains a single floret (one fertile grass flower), protected by papery glumes. When in full flower, the delicate anthers can sometimes be seen dangling from the spikelets like tiny yellow threads. After pollination, the spikelets develop grain-like seeds. The overall aspect of the plant is lanky and bending – unlike stiff meadow grasses, this woodreed has a soft, nodding form adapted to low light and humid air. By autumn, the entire inflorescence dries to a straw color and the stems may topple, scattering seeds into the leaf litter.",
    "similar": "In the deep woods, few grasses attain the height and drooping elegance of Drooping Woodreed. One grass that also favors woodlands is *Nodding Fescue* (*Festuca subverticillata*), but it is shorter (usually under 2 feet) with a much more modest, weakly nodding seed head. Some sedges (*Carex* spp.) and woodrushes (*Luzula* spp.) in similar habitats have drooping clusters of fruits, but sedges typically have solid triangular stems and thicker, bristly seed clusters, and woodrushes have very fine, dark brown star-like flowers – quite different upon close inspection. If compared to sun-loving grasses, woodreed’s broad leaves and airy, dangling panicle set it apart (most field grasses have upright or only slightly arching panicles). Perhaps the most confusion could come from young wild rye or brome grasses in semi-shade, but those have tighter flower spikes. The unique combination of a tall stature, very loose nodding panicle, and preference for deep woods makes Cinna latifolia distinctive. Observers who notice a “weeping” grass along a brook in a northern forest are likely seeing Drooping Woodreed.",
    "ecology": "A rhizomatous woodland grass that quickly occupies moist gaps and skid-trails, binding loose soils with fibrous roots and stabilizing seepage slopes. Its airy panicles feed seed-eating sparrows and small mammals in late summer, while foliage hosts leaf-miner and skipper larvae typical of native forest grasses. By shading bare soil and catching litter, it speeds recovery of disturbed understory patches and facilitates later colonization by forbs and shrubs.",
    "status": "Drooping Woodreed is secure on a global scale (widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere), and in the White Mountain region it’s considered a natural component of the forest flora without any special conservation status. It can be locally patchy – found abundantly in one favorable ravine and absent on a nearby drier hillside – reflecting its need for moist, undisturbed soil. In New Hampshire and surrounding states, it isn’t rare, but because it inhabits interior forests, people don’t encounter it as frequently as field or roadside grasses. The species benefits from the preservation of mature forest ecosystems and riparian corridors. Forestry practices that maintain stream buffers and wet hollows help ensure this graceful grass continues to flourish. Overall, there are no major threats to it apart from general habitat loss; given the extensive forests in our region, Drooping Woodreed is doing well. It quietly contributes to forest biodiversity, and its presence signals a cool, healthy woodland – an environment that remains relatively intact."
