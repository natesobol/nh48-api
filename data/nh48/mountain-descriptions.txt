North Tripyramid – Mount Tripyramid (North Peak) is one of the three summits of Mount Tripyramid in the Sandwich Range of the White Mountains. The North Peak stands at 4,180 feet (1,274 m), making it the highest of the Tripyramid trio. It is located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. North Tripyramid, along with Middle Tripyramid, is included on the Appalachian Mountain Club’s list of 4,000-footers. The two peaks are connected by a ridge and separated by a deep col. The summit of North Tripyramid is wooded, but a hike up its steep North Slide (for experienced hikers) or the gentler approach from the south provides views along the way, and there are limited outlooks near the summit itself.
Mount Cabot – Mount Cabot is a 4,170-foot mountain located in Coös County, New Hampshire. It is the highest peak in the Pilot Range of the White Mountains and the northernmost of New Hampshire’s 48 four-thousand footers.

The mountain is heavily forested. Its summit has a clearing (where a fire lookout tower once stood) but only obstructed views; however, nearby viewpoints on the trail, such as Bunnell Rock, offer nice vistas to the south and east.
East Osceola – Mount Osceola, East Peak (often simply called East Osceola) is a 4,156-foot mountain in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. It is a subordinate peak of Mount Osceola, located to the east of Osceola’s main summit along the ridge in the town of Lincoln (Grafton County). East Osceola is reached via the Greeley Pond Trail and Mount Osceola Trail, typically on the way to or from the main summit of Mount Osceola. The summit of East Osceola is wooded and marked by a cairn, offering little in terms of views. Despite its lack of vistas, it counts as a separate 4,000-footer due to the prominence drop between it and Mount Osceola.
Middle Tripyramid – Mount Tripyramid, Middle Peak is a 4,140-foot summit in the Sandwich Range of the White Mountains, located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is the middle of the three Tripyramid peaks and the second-highest (after North Tripyramid). Middle Tripyramid is also included in the official 4,000-footers list. Like North Tripyramid, its summit is wooded with no direct views. The peaks are often hiked together via the Mt. Tripyramid Trail (which ascends the steep North Slide and descends the South Slide), and hikers can find good views from the slide areas or from Scaur Ridge nearby. Middle Tripyramid just meets the prominence requirement above the col with North Tripyramid to count as a distinct summit.
Cannon Mountain – Cannon Mountain is a 4,100-foot (1,249 m) mountain located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is situated at the northern end of the Franconia Range, overlooking Franconia Notch. Cannon Mountain is known for its nearly vertical east face of cliffs (the site of the former Old Man of the Mountain rock profile) and for the Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway, which carries visitors to near its summit.

At the summit, an observation tower provides excellent views of Franconia Notch, the Kinsman Range, and the surrounding White Mountains.
Mount Hale – Mount Hale is a 4,054-foot mountain in Grafton County, New Hampshire. The mountain is part of the Twin Range of the White Mountains and is situated in the Bethlehem area within the White Mountain National Forest. Mount Hale was named after Reverend Edward Everett Hale (1822–1909). Its summit is wooded and capped by a large rock pile left from a former fire tower. Because of the tree cover, there are no sweeping views at the very top, but limited outlooks can be found on the trail during the ascent. Mount Hale is considered one of the shorter and easier 4,000-footer hikes, often climbed from the Zealand Road area.
Mount Jackson – Mount Jackson is a mountain in Coös County, New Hampshire. The mountain is named after Charles Thomas Jackson, a 19th-century state geologist, and is part of the Presidential Range of the White Mountains.

Mount Tom – Mount Tom is a 4,052-foot mountain in the Willey Range of the White Mountains, located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It was named for Thomas Crawford, a 19th-century innkeeper of Crawford Notch (and part of the family for whom Crawford Notch is named). Mount Tom is often hiked together with neighboring Mount Field and Mount Willey. The summit of Mount Tom is forested with no direct views, but just below the summit, hikers can find viewpoints that offer vistas toward the Presidential Range and down into Crawford Notch. A notable feature on its slopes is the bird population; Mount Tom is known as a good place to spot Canada jays near the summit.
Mount Moriah – Mount Moriah is a 4,049-foot mountain in Coös County, New Hampshire. It is the northernmost peak on the Appalachian Mountain Club’s list of 4,000-footers in the White Mountains. Mount Moriah is part of the Carter-Moriah Range and stands to the northeast of Pinkham Notch, overlooking the town of Gorham. The summit, reached via the Carter-Moriah Trail (which is also the Appalachian Trail in this section), consists of open ledges that provide excellent views. From Mount Moriah’s summit one can see the Presidential Range to the west, as well as the Carter Range and the Wild River Wilderness. The mountain’s name comes from the Bible (likely named by 19th-century mapmakers), keeping with the theme after nearby Mount Zion and the town of Bethel, Maine to the east.
Mount Passaconaway – Mount Passaconaway is a 4,043-foot mountain in the Sandwich Range, located in Grafton County (town of Waterville Valley), New Hampshire. The mountain is named after Passaconaway, a legendary 17th-century sachem (chief) of the Pennacook people. Mount Passaconaway is densely wooded on top; its summit is tree-covered with a small cairn marking the high point. Although the summit itself has no view, a short spur path leads to a clearing with an excellent southward outlook. Mount Passaconaway is often hiked along with neighboring Mount Whiteface, and it is known for its steep, challenging ascents (such as via the Dicey’s Mill Trail or the Walden Trail) and for the wilderness feel of the Bowl Research Natural Area on its eastern flank.
Owl’s Head – Owl’s Head is a 4,025-foot mountain deep in the Pemigewasset Wilderness of the White Mountains, in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is one of the more remote and challenging peaks on the NH 4,000-footers list to reach, as there is no official trail all the way to the summit (hikers follow unofficial herd paths up a steep slide and through dense woods). The mountain is named for a distinctive rock outcropping on its western side that is said to resemble the profile of an owl’s head. Owl’s Head’s summit is wooded and viewless, but along the ascent of the Owl’s Head slide there are impressive views of the surrounding peaks, including Franconia Ridge to the west and the Bonds to the east. This peak’s isolation and difficult access make it an infamous checkmark for peak-baggers.
Mount Whiteface – Mount Whiteface is a 4,020-foot mountain in the Sandwich Range of the White Mountains, straddling the border of Grafton and Carroll counties in New Hampshire. The mountain is named for the large white granite cliff on its southeast face. Mount Whiteface’s summit is wooded and marked by a cairn just off the trail with limited views, but just below the summit, open ledges on the Blueberry Ledge Trail provide expansive views south and east, including Lake Winnipesaukee and the Ossipee Range. Mount Whiteface is often climbed together with Mount Passaconaway to its north, and both peaks lie within the White Mountain National Forest’s Sandwich Range Wilderness.
Mount Waumbek – Mount Waumbek is a 4,006-foot mountain in Coös County, New Hampshire. It is part of the Pliny Range in the northern White Mountains and is the third-highest peak in that range (after Mount Starr King, which is on the same ridge, and Mount Cabot to the east). Mount Waumbek is typically hiked via a trail that passes over Mount Starr King. The summit of Waumbek is wooded, with a limited clearing that provides a restricted view towards the Presidential Range. Being one of the northernmost 4,000-footers, Mount Waumbek is often one of the last peaks hikers climb to complete the NH48 list. The mountain’s name “Waumbek” comes from an Abenaki word, often interpreted to mean “white rock” or “snowy” (perhaps referencing its snowy winters).
Mount Isolation – Mount Isolation is a 4,004-foot mountain in Coös County, New Hampshire. True to its name, it is one of the most isolated peaks in the White Mountains, situated in the Dry River Wilderness area at the southern end of the Presidential Range. Mount Isolation is the highest summit on the Montalban Ridge, which extends south from Mount Washington. Hiking to Mount Isolation requires a long journey (generally 12–14 miles round trip), often via Glen Boulder Trail and Davis Path or Rocky Branch Trail and Isolation Trail. The summit of Mount Isolation has an open ledge that yields outstanding views, especially of Mount Washington and the southern Presidentials to the north and of the Pemigewasset Wilderness to the west. Its remoteness and length of hike make it a challenging but rewarding peak for dedicated hikers.
Mount Tecumseh – Mount Tecumseh is a 4,003-foot mountain in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is the shortest mountain among the 48 NH 4,000-footers. Mount Tecumseh is part of the Sandwich Range and is most famous as the home of Waterville Valley Resort; ski trails cut through its northeastern slope. The mountain was named after the famous Shawnee chief Tecumseh. A hiking trail (the Mount Tecumseh Trail) leads to its summit from the ski area base. The summit is wooded, but a few outlook points near the top, and on ski trails, can provide views towards neighboring mountains like Mount Osceola, and down to the Waterville Valley. Mount Tecumseh’s modest elevation and accessible trail make it a popular hike, especially for beginners working on the 4,000-footer list.
Wildcat Mountain (D Peak) – Wildcat Mountain “D” Peak is a 4,050-foot summit on Wildcat Mountain, located in Coös County, New Hampshire. It is at the northwest end of the Wildcat Ridge, directly above the Wildcat Mountain Ski Area in Pinkham Notch. Wildcat D is one of two summits of Wildcat Mountain recognized as 4,000-footers (the other being the higher “A” Peak). The summit of Wildcat D is the site of the top of a gondola lift and an observation deck, from which there are spectacular views across Pinkham Notch to Mount Washington and the Presidential Range. Wildcat D Peak is often the starting or ending point for hikers traversing the Wildcat Ridge Trail, which runs from Pinkham Notch over Wildcat’s peaks and on toward Carter Dome.
