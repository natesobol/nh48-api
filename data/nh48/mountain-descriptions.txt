Mount Washington – Mount Washington is an ultra-prominent mountain in the state of New Hampshire. It is the highest peak in the Northeastern United States at 6,288 feet (1,917 m) and the most topographically prominent mountain east of the Mississippi River. The mountain is notorious for its erratic weather, once holding the world record for the highest wind speed measured at the surface. It lies in the Presidential Range of the White Mountains, in Coös County, and its summit area includes the Mount Washington State Park (surrounded by the White Mountain National Forest). Mount Washington is the highest peak in the Northeastern United States and an ultra-prominent summit. It’s notorious for erratic weather, once holding the world record for highest surface wind speed. The mountain was known to Native Americans as Agiocochook, meaning “Home of the Great Spirit,” and indigenous peoples regarded its summit as sacred, rarely climbing it. The first recorded ascent was in 1642 by Darby Field, who climbed it with two Native guides. By the mid-19th century, the summit had become one of America’s first tourist destinations: the Summit House hotel opened in 1852 and the Tip-Top House in 1853. The Mount Washington Auto Road was completed in 1861 and the Cog Railway in 1869, the latter being the world’s first mountain-climbing cog railway. These developments (many of which still operate) made Mount Washington a centerpiece of White Mountain tourism. The summit area is partly in Mount Washington State Park, surrounded by the White Mountain National Forest.
Mount Adams – Mount Adams is a 5,774-foot mountain in the Presidential Range of the White Mountains. It is the second-highest mountain in New Hampshire, after Mount Washington. The mountain was named after President John Adams. Mount Adams is known for its expansive above-treeline summit and rugged terrain, and it stands just north of Mount Jefferson in the northern Presidential Range. Mount Adams is the second-highest mountain in New Hampshire, located in the northern Presidential Range just north of Mount Washington. It was named after President John Adams, and this name was bestowed on July 31, 1820 by a naming expedition guided by Ethan Allen Crawford. Mount Adams is known for its expansive above-treeline area and rugged terrain, including sub-peaks named for John Adams’ family (e.g. Sam Adams, Quincy Adams). In the late 19th century the Randolph Mountain Club began developing trails and high camps on its slopes; even today several hikers’ shelters (Crag Camp, Gray Knob, etc.) maintained by the RMC dot the north side of Adams. The mountain’s alpine environment and proximity to Mount Washington have made it popular with peak-baggers and winter mountaineers, despite its challenging weather (winds and cold here can rival Antarctic conditions).
Mount Jefferson – Mount Jefferson is a 5,712-foot mountain in Coös County, New Hampshire. It is the third-highest peak in the state. Named after Thomas Jefferson (the third President of the United States), Mount Jefferson is part of the Presidential Range of the White Mountains. It is situated between Mount Adams to the northeast and Mount Clay to the south, and features steep, rocky slopes and alpine terrain characteristic of the northern Presidentials. Mount Jefferson, the third-highest peak in the state, is named for Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. President. It received this name during the same 1820 naming event that christened Mount Adams and Mount Monroe. Mount Jefferson is distinguished by three dramatic glacial cirques on its slopes — Jefferson Ravine, Castle Ravine, and the Great Gulf — carved by Ice Age glaciers. Near its rocky summit is an alpine sedge meadow dubbed “Monticello Lawn,” a nod to Jefferson’s Virginia estate. Early hikers in the 19th century were awed by these unique features, and the mountain’s Caps Ridge Trail (whose trailhead is on the highest public road in NH) has been a popular direct route for over a century. Mount Jefferson stands between Mount Adams and Mount Clay, completing the northern trio of major Presidentials.
Mount Monroe – Mount Monroe is a 5,384-foot mountain in the Presidential Range of the White Mountains. Located just southwest of Mount Washington, it is the fourth-highest 4,000-footer in New Hampshire. The peak is named after James Monroe, the fifth U.S. President. Mount Monroe has a sharp, rocky summit and offers 360-degree views, including a close perspective of the Lakes of the Clouds and the southern Presidential peaks. Mount Monroe is the fourth-highest 4,000-footer in New Hampshire, located just southwest of Mount Washington. The peak is named after James Monroe, fifth U.S. President, and it was so designated by the 1820 explorers (Monroe was the sitting president at the time). Interestingly, due to a surveying mistake, Mount Monroe is actually about 20 feet taller than Mount Madison (named for the 4th President), disrupting the intended height-order correlation of presidential names. Mount Monroe has a sharp, rocky summit and offers 360-degree views, including a close perspective of the Lakes of the Clouds tarns and the southern Presidential peaks. In 1915 the Lakes of the Clouds Hut was built on its shoulder, and it has provided refuge to hikers for over a century. Monroe’s alpine zone and proximity to Mount Washington have made it a witness to many historical mountain events, from early scientific observatory work to the famous 1908 auto road races on nearby slopes.
Mount Madison – Mount Madison is a 5,367-foot mountain at the northern end of the Presidential Range in New Hampshire. It is the fifth-highest peak in the state. Mount Madison was named after President James Madison. As the northernmost Presidentials summit, it overlooks the town of Gorham and features the Madison Spring Hut nearby. The summit consists of a cone of talus rocks with sweeping views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. Mount Madison lies at the northern end of the Presidential Range and is the fifth-highest peak in New Hampshire. It was named in honor of James Madison, the fourth U.S. President, during the 1820 naming expedition. As the northernmost Presidential summit, it has long served as a gateway for hikers approaching the range from the Gorham side. In 1888, the Madison Spring Hut was built in the col between Madison and Adams – this was the first high-mountain hut in the United States, established by the Appalachian Mountain Club. (The hut has been expanded and rebuilt several times since.) Mount Madison’s summit is a cone of talus rocks with sweeping views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. Nearby, the valley of Snyder Brook became a hub of early trail-building – many paths on and around Madison were cut in the late 19th century, reflecting the mountain’s popularity among the Victorian-era White Mountain adventurers.
Mount Lafayette – Mount Lafayette is a 5,249-foot (1,600 m) mountain at the northern end of the Franconia Range in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. It lies in Franconia, Grafton County, and is the highest peak outside the Presidential Range. The mountain’s upper reaches are in the alpine zone, with only dwarf vegetation due to the harsh climate. Mount Lafayette is known for its spectacular views and is a prominent feature of the popular Franconia Ridge loop hike. Mount Lafayette is the highest peak outside the Presidential Range and anchors the northern end of the Franconia Range. In earlier times, local settlers called this mountain “Great Haystack” for its profile. It was renamed Mount Lafayette in 1824 to honor the Marquis de Lafayette, the famed French general who toured the United States that year. (Lafayette’s visit to New Hampshire was a celebrated event, and the mountain was christened with appropriate ceremonies.) The mountain’s upper reaches are in the alpine zone, with only dwarf vegetation due to the harsh climate. Mount Lafayette has long been known for its spectacular views; artists and tourists in the 19th century frequented vantage points like Profile House to admire Lafayette and its neighbors. In 1929, the AMC’s Greenleaf Hut opened on its shoulder, further cementing Lafayette as a hiking destination. Today, the peak is best known as part of the popular Franconia Ridge loop hike, and it stands as a symbol of New Hampshire’s scenic beauty.
Mount Lincoln – Mount Lincoln is a 5,089-foot (1,551 m) mountain in the Franconia Range of the White Mountains. It is situated just south of Mount Lafayette, and the two peaks are often hiked together via Franconia Ridge. Mount Lincoln is the eighth-highest 4,000-footer in New Hampshire. The summit is above treeline, providing panoramic views of the Franconia Notch region and beyond. Mount Lincoln is a major summit on Franconia Ridge, just south of Mount Lafayette. The mountain is named for President Abraham Lincoln, a name likely bestowed in the mid-19th century after Lincoln’s presidency (replacing older local terms for the peak). In fact, Lincoln, Lafayette, and their neighboring summits were once collectively referred to as the “Haystack Mountains” by settlers. Only later did individual names take hold, reflecting national historical figures. Mount Lincoln’s rocky cone is above treeline, providing panoramic views of the Franconia Notch region and beyond. The dramatic ridge trail between Lincoln and Lafayette has been drawing hikers since the 1800s – it was traveled by early AMC explorers who built the Franconia Ridge Trail. Today, Mount Lincoln is often hiked together with Lafayette and Little Haystack as part of the classic loop, allowing hikers to experience the same breathtaking vistas that have been written about since the days of poets like Thoreau.
South Twin Mountain – South Twin Mountain is a 4,902-foot mountain located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. The mountain is part of the Twin Range of the White Mountains. South Twin forms the highest point of a north–south ridge, with North Twin Mountain about a mile to the north and Mount Guyot to the southeast. The summit of South Twin is open and rocky, offering broad vistas, while its slopes are covered in spruce-fir forest. South Twin Mountain is one of the two prominent “Twin” peaks in the Twin Range (the higher of the pair). Its summit is open and rocky, offering broad vistas into the Pemigewasset Wilderness and across to the Franconia Range. The Twin Range area has a notable conservation history: in the late 19th century it was heavily logged, and then devastating forest fires swept through in 1903 and 1908, burning the west side of the Twins and areas around neighboring Owl’s Head. These events, which left slopes barren, helped spur the movement to protect the White Mountains from further destruction. In 1911 the Weeks Act was passed, and much of this region eventually became part of the White Mountain National Forest. Today, South Twin’s slopes have regrown with spruce-fir forest, and the peak marks the highest point of a north–south ridge (with North Twin a mile to the north and Mount Guyot to the southeast). Near its summit, the Appalachian Mountain Club’s Galehead Hut (built in 1932) sits at Galehead col, a testament to the area’s long-running use by hikers.
Carter Dome – Carter Dome, or simply “The Dome,” is a mountain in Coös County, New Hampshire. It has an elevation of 4,832 feet (1,473 m), which makes it one of the highest peaks in the White Mountains. Carter Dome is part of the Carter-Moriah Range, running along the eastern side of Pinkham Notch. The mountain is flanked to the northeast by Mount Hight and to the southwest by Wildcat Mountain (across Carter Notch). Carter Dome’s summit is wooded, and it is known for the nearby Carter Notch Hut and the views obtainable from points just off its summit. Carter Dome (often just “The Dome”) is the highest peak of the Carter-Moriah Range, east of Mount Washington across Pinkham Notch. The mountain is named for the Carter family – early 19th-century settlers or guides in the region – although the exact honoree is debated (some sources cite Dr. Ezra Carter of Concord, others a local hunter). Historically, Carter Dome had a fire lookout tower on its summit from 1907 to 1947. Rangers stationed there could scan the Wild River wilderness to the east and the Pinkham Notch region for signs of wildfire. The old tower is gone now, and the summit is wooded, but traces remain. At the northern base of Carter Dome lies Carter Notch, where the Appalachian Mountain Club built the Carter Notch Hut in 1914 – one of the first high-mountain huts in the Whites. Generations of hikers have passed through that notch and ascended Carter Dome, making it a peak rich with hiking lore. Despite being just shy of treeline, Carter Dome offers fine views from nearby Mount Hight and other outlooks, including sights back toward the Presidential Range.
Mount Moosilauke – Mount Moosilauke is a 4,802-foot mountain at the southwestern end of the White Mountains, located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. The name “Moosilauke” comes from an Abenaki word meaning “bald place,” reflecting its expansive treeless summit. This mountain stands apart from the main ranges, offering wide panoramic views in all directions. Mount Moosilauke is the tenth-highest 4,000-footer in the state and is notable for its alpine tundra zone and the historic Moosilauke Ravine Lodge at its base. Mount Moosilauke sits at the southwestern end of the White Mountains, somewhat separate from the main ranges. The name “Moosilauke” comes from an Abenaki word meaning “bald place,” referring to its expansive treeless summit (also historically spelled “Moosehillock”). Mount Moosilauke has a storied history as a recreation spot. In the mid-19th century, it was home to one of the earliest summit hotels in the region: in 1860, the Prospect House was built on the summit (later replaced by the Tip Top House). For decades, travelers would ascend via carriage road to stay on Moosilauke’s peak. That summit house ultimately burned down in 1942, marking the end of an era. Moosilauke was also a cradle of early American skiing – the Dartmouth Outing Club cut ski trails on its slopes in the 1920s, including the famous Carriage Road ski trail, making it one of the first mountains in the country to host organized skiing. The mountain’s gentle southwest slope and fierce alpine summit winds were even used for scientific experiments (for example, measuring atmospheric electricity in the 1940s). Today, Moosilauke remains a beloved hiking mountain. At its base is the historic Moosilauke Ravine Lodge (built by Dartmouth in the 1930s, rebuilt in 2017), continuing a long tradition of welcoming visitors to the “Gentle Giant” of the White Mountains.
Mount Eisenhower – Mount Eisenhower is a 4,780-foot mountain in the Presidential Range of the White Mountains. It lies in Coös County and is one of the southern Presidentials. Formerly known as Mount Pleasant, it was renamed to honor President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Mount Eisenhower has a broad, dome-shaped summit that is mostly treeless, providing hikers with excellent 360-degree views of the surrounding peaks and valleys. Mount Eisenhower is one of the southern Presidential Range peaks, known for its broad, dome-shaped summit (largely treeless) with excellent 360-degree views. This mountain was originally named Mount Pleasant by the 1820 Weeks-Brackett exploration party. For many years it was referred to as Mount Pleasant, while other nearby peaks took on Presidents’ names. After President Dwight D. Eisenhower died in 1969, there was a movement to honor him in the White Mountains. In 1970 the U.S. Board on Geographic Names officially changed Mount Pleasant to Mount Eisenhower. The peak’s rounded summit and alpine environment have made it a favorite for hikers and campers; even before the renaming, it was popular as the last above-treeline stop on the Crawford Path heading north. A summit cairn and the remnants of an old shelter site can be found on top. Mount Eisenhower’s history is quieter than some of its neighbors – it lacks the railway or roads – but its name reflects the state’s pride in the only U.S. President (so far) to visit these peaks during his lifetime (Eisenhower took a trip up Mount Washington in 1955). Today’s hikers often note the contrast between the peak’s tranquil nature and the global significance of its namesake.
North Twin Mountain – North Twin Mountain is a 4,761-foot mountain in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is part of the Twin Range of the White Mountains and lies about one mile north of its higher neighbor, South Twin Mountain. North Twin is the twelfth-highest of the New Hampshire 4,000-footers. The summit is wooded with limited views, but a short spur near the top leads to ledges that offer excellent vistas, including sights of South Twin Mountain, the Franconia Ridge, and the Pemigewasset Wilderness. North Twin Mountain is the slightly lower sibling of South Twin, located about one mile to its north. The “Twin Mountains” name dates back to at least the 19th century; some say the nearby village of Twin Mountain was named for these peaks, and vice versa. North Twin’s summit is wooded with limited views, but just below it, a short spur path leads to ledges that offer excellent vistas (including a striking perspective on South Twin, the Franconia Ridge, and the depths of the Pemigewasset Wilderness). This wilderness, which North Twin overlooks, was extensively logged and burned from the 1880s into the 1940s, leaving vast clear-cuts and charred land. In 1984, the area was designated as the Pemigewasset Wilderness under federal law, protecting 45,000 acres and allowing the forest to recover to its natural state. Thus, North Twin today stands guard over a rewilded landscape. Traces of old logging camps and rail grades can still be found in the valleys below. North Twin itself never had a fire tower or buildings; its main human history is the trail network (the North Twin Trail and others) built by the AMC in the early 1900s to facilitate tramping in this once-devastated, now-pristine region.
Mount Carrigain – Mount Carrigain is a 4,700-foot mountain in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, located in Grafton County. It is an isolated peak standing near the center of the White Mountain National Forest. Mount Carrigain is known for the expansive views from its summit fire tower, which overlook nearly all the other 4,000-footers. The mountain is the tallest peak in the Pemigewasset Wilderness area and is often cited as having one of the best summit panoramas in the Whites. Mount Carrigain is an isolated peak near the center of the White Mountain National Forest, revered for the expansive views from its summit. The mountain was named for Phillip Carrigain – New Hampshire’s Secretary of State from 1805–1810 and an accomplished cartographer who produced an important 1816 map of NH. (Carrigain himself participated in an 1819 exploratory climb of this then-unmapped mountain.) By 1910, as the White Mountains experienced frequent fires, a fire lookout was established on Mount Carrigain’s summit. Over the years, several wooden fire towers stood on Carrigain. The last full tower was removed in the late 20th century, but the steel viewing platform that remains today actually sits on the base of the final tower (providing one of the finest panoramas in the Whites). Mount Carrigain’s slopes saw logging activity in the early 1900s (notably in Carrigain Notch), but its ruggedness spared it from complete deforestation. It now rises at the heart of the Pemigewasset Wilderness region and is often cited as having a “see everything” view – you can spot nearly all the other 4,000-footers from its platform on a clear day. In White Mountain lore, Carrigain is also famous as the location where photographer Guy Shorey took an iconic panorama in 1925, capturing the vastness of the forest just before the federal government purchased it for preservation.
Mount Bond – Mount Bond is a 4,698-foot mountain in Grafton County, New Hampshire. The mountain was named after Professor George P. Bond (1825–1865) of Harvard University. It is the southernmost peak of the Twin Range in the White Mountains and is situated deep within the Pemigewasset Wilderness. Mount Bond has a bare summit that offers panoramic views, and it is flanked to the north by Mount Guyot. Together with its subsidiary peaks West Bond and Bondcliff, it forms a trio commonly known as “The Bonds,” all of which are included in the list of 4,000-footers. Mount Bond is the central and highest peak of a trio of remote summits known as “The Bonds”, deep in the Pemigewasset Wilderness. It was named for Professor George P. Bond (1825–1865) of Harvard College Observatory – a pioneer in astrophotography and son of the first director of the Observatory. This naming was done by 19th-century AMC explorers who honored prominent scientists (Mount Bond’s neighbor, Mount Guyot, was similarly named for geographer Arnold Guyot). Mount Bond’s summit is above treeline and rocky, yielding panoramic views. Historically, the region around Mount Bond was one of the last areas of the Whites to be penetrated by loggers – J.E. Henry’s East Branch & Lincoln Railroad reached near these slopes in the late 1890s, and vast clear-cutting ensued in the neighboring valleys. By the 1920s, the entire Pemigewasset was a wasteland of stumps. Today, however, the wilderness has regenerated. Congress designated the Pemigewasset Wilderness in 1984, ensuring the forests around Mount Bond remain protected. Hikers who trek the long miles to Mount Bond and its subpeaks (West Bond and Bondcliff) often remark on the sense of history and renewal – walking on old railroad grades, seeing remnants of logging camps, and then standing on the wild, windswept summit that feels a world apart from civilization.
Middle Carter Mountain – Middle Carter Mountain is a 4,610-foot mountain located in Coös County, New Hampshire. The mountain is part of the Carter-Moriah Range of the White Mountains, which runs along the northeast side of Pinkham Notch. Middle Carter is flanked to the north by North Carter Mountain and to the southwest by South Carter Mountain. The summit of Middle Carter is wooded, but there are a few outlook points near the summit that provide nice views of the Presidential Range and the Wild River wilderness to the east. Middle Carter is one of several peaks along the Carter-Moriah ridge, which runs parallel to the Presidential Range on the east side of Pinkham Notch. Like its neighboring Carters, Middle Carter’s name comes from the early settlers or hunters named Carter who frequented the area (possibly after Dr. Ezra Carter of Concord, though the exact origin is uncertain). The Carter family name was applied to the range in the mid-19th century when the area was being mapped. The summit of Middle Carter is wooded and modest, but a few nearby outlook points on the trail offer beautiful views westward to Mount Washington and east into the Wild River wilderness. This area experienced heavy logging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries – the Wild River Valley just east of Middle Carter was logged by the Hastings Lumber Company and then ravaged by a massive forest fire in 1903. In fact, fires in 1903 burned much of the Carter Range’s virgin forest, leading to relocation of trails and eventually the push for forest preservation. Today, Middle Carter stands in a second-growth forest that has recovered over the past hundred years. Hikers traversing the Carter ridge follow routes (like the Carter-Moriah Trail) that were laid out by the AMC in the early 1900s once the area became part of the National Forest.
West Bond – West Bond is a subsidiary peak of Mount Bond, with an elevation of approximately 4,540 feet. It is located in Lincoln, New Hampshire (Grafton County), deep in the Pemigewasset Wilderness. West Bond is one of three peaks collectively known as The Bonds (along with Mount Bond and Bondcliff). Although lower than Mount Bond, West Bond is notable for its solitude and the excellent views it offers of the surrounding wilderness, including a close perspective of Bondcliff’s dramatic cliffs. West Bond is a subsidiary peak of Mount Bond, known for its fine vista of Bondcliff’s cliffs and the surrounding wilderness. It is one of the three “Bonds” and, like the others, it was named in honor of Professor George P. Bond (the name simply extending to the western spur of Mount Bond). West Bond itself didn’t receive much specific attention in early accounts – it is more the quiet sibling to Bond and Bondcliff. However, its location deep in the Pemigewasset Wilderness means its history is tied to that of the East Branch logging railroad as well. In the late 19th century, logging camps operated not far from its base in the Hellgate and Franconia Brook areas. By 1900, the forests on the approaches to West Bond were largely cut and then later regenerated. Wilderness designation in 1984 has ensured that West Bond’s environs remain roadless and wild. Requiring a long hike to reach, West Bond was seldom visited until the advent of peak-bagging lists – one early recorded ascent was in 1916 by AMC explorer Arthur L. Goodrich during a grand tour of the new White Mountain National Forest lands. Today, standing on the tiny bare summit of West Bond, one can appreciate the enduring wildness of the Whites and imagine the barren slash lands of a century ago now transformed into unbroken green forest.
Mount Garfield – Mount Garfield is a 4,500-foot mountain in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is part of the Franconia Range and sits at the northern end of the Pemigewasset Wilderness. The summit of Mount Garfield has the stone foundations of an old fire lookout tower and provides outstanding views, especially of the Franconia Ridge (including nearby Mount Lafayette and Mount Lincoln) and down into the Pemigewasset Wilderness. The mountain is typically accessed by the Garfield Trail and is a popular destination for hikers seeking a moderately challenging climb with great payoff in views. Mount Garfield is a prominent peak at the northwestern end of the Franconia Range, overlooking the Pemigewasset Wilderness. It was named for James A. Garfield, the 20th President of the United States, who served in 1881. This naming likely occurred in the late 19th century, following President Garfield’s assassination, as part of a trend of honoring American leaders in the White Mountains. The summit of Mount Garfield has the stone foundations of an old fire lookout tower – a wooden tower operated here from 1940 to 1948. Forest service personnel once staffed it to watch for wildfires across the remote Pemi region. Even earlier, in the 1910s, Garfield’s summit was used as a survey point when the U.S. Geological Survey was mapping the White Mountains (there’s a benchmark from 1913 on top). The foundations hikers see today were part of the second tower (1942) which was removed in the 1970s. Garfield has long been popular with hikers seeking a moderately challenging climb with a great payoff. The classic Garfield Trail follows an old firewarden’s route (and before that, possibly a logging road from the 1870s when the area to the north, in Gale River valley, was logged). From the summit’s remains of the tower, one enjoys outstanding views – especially of the Franconia Ridge (Lafayette, Lincoln, etc.) across the valley and deep into the wild heart of the Whites.
Mount Galehead – Mount Galehead is just over 4,000 ft, flanked by Mt. Garfield and South Twin, and features an AMC hut that is open seasonally. Views are limited to the area just in front of the AMC hut, and the summit is well forested. Mount Galehead is a wooded peak flanked by Mount Garfield and South Twin Mountain. While the summit itself is entirely forested with only a small cairn marking the high point, Galehead is notable for the AMC Galehead Hut located just to its south at 3,800 feet. This hut, opened in 1932, is the most isolated of the Appalachian Mountain Club’s hut system. It was constructed from native logs (a Herculean task given its remote location) and famously survived the Great New England Hurricane of 1938 with only minor damage. By the 1990s the original hut was showing its age, and in 2000 a new Galehead Hut was built on the same site, incorporating solar panels and other modern features while still offering rustic mountain hospitality. The peak’s name “Galehead” likely derives from the nearby Gale River or the old Gale River logging camp – the word “Gale” itself might refer to a person (possibly a 19th-century logger or surveyor named Gale). In the early 20th century, the slopes around Galehead were logged by the Gale River Lumber Company; a logging railroad grade crossed just below where the hut now stands. When the area became part of the National Forest, logging ceased and the trails came in. Views from Galehead are limited to a spot near the hut’s porch, where one can gaze out to the craggy face of Garfield and the Twin Range. In a way, Galehead’s history encapsulates the evolution of the Whites: once logged and abandoned, then protected and now hosting outdoor enthusiasts in a regenerated wilderness.
Mount Liberty – Mount Liberty is a 4,459-foot mountain in the Franconia Range of the White Mountains. Located in Grafton County just south of Franconia Notch, it is a prominent peak visible from the notch area. Mount Liberty’s summit is largely open, with a distinctive rocky cone that affords panoramic views – particularly of the neighboring Mount Flume to the south and the higher peaks of Franconia Ridge (Lincoln and Lafayette) to the north. It is often hiked in combination with Mount Flume via the Franconia Ridge Trail. Mount Liberty is a striking cone-shaped peak at the south end of Franconia Ridge, directly overlooking Franconia Notch. Its rocky summit is largely open, affording panoramic views – particularly of neighboring Mount Flume to the south and the higher peaks (Lincoln and Lafayette) to the north. The mountain’s name reflects American patriotic sentiment; it likely was named “Liberty” in the mid-19th century (possibly around the time of the Civil War or soon after). Earlier settlers actually grouped Liberty with other peaks in the range under the moniker “Haystack” mountains – Mount Liberty itself was sometimes called “Great Haystack” or “South Peak” before formal naming caught on. One historical feature on Mount Liberty’s slope is the Liberty Spring, a reliable water source that was well-known to 19th-century hikers and led to the creation of the Liberty Spring Trail (blazed by the AMC in the late 1800s). In 1925, the AMC built Liberty Spring Campsite near that spring to accommodate the increasing number of trampers on Franconia Ridge. Mount Liberty also played a small role during the 1927–28 effort to protect Franconia Notch from logging: conservationists pointed to the scenic value of peaks like Liberty to rally public support for creating Franconia Notch State Park (established in 1928). Today, Mount Liberty is often climbed in combination with Flume, and from its summit one can still see the intact forested slopes of the notch, spared from the saw by those early conservation efforts.
South Carter Mountain – South Carter Mountain is a 4,430-foot mountain located in Coös County, New Hampshire. The mountain is part of the Carter-Moriah Range of the White Mountains. South Carter is flanked to the northeast by Middle Carter Mountain and to the southeast by Mount Hight. Like the other Carter Range peaks, its summit is wooded, and views are limited from the top, but nearby clearings along the ridge trail offer sightlines toward the Presidential Range and the Wild River valley. South Carter is another peak on the Carter-Moriah Range, lying between Middle Carter to the northeast and Mount Hight (and Carter Dome) to the southwest. It is densely wooded at the summit, like most of the Carters, with limited views. The Carter peaks derive their name from the prominent Carter family in 19th-century White Mountain history. There is some mystery as to the exact namesake – it could be in honor of Dr. Ezra Carter, a physician from Concord who was an early mountain explorer, or it could memorialize a local hunter/trapper named Carter who frequented the notch; we may never know for sure. South Carter’s history is intertwined with the development of the Carter-Moriah Trail, which was completed in the 1890s to connect the range for hikers. This trail construction came after the establishment of the White Mountain National Forest (1910s) because prior to that the area saw extensive logging. In fact, the slope east of South Carter drains into the Wild River, where huge fires in 1903 burned out the slash left by loggers. Since inclusion in the National Forest, the forests on South Carter have regrown. There was never a fire tower on South Carter (a tower was on nearby Mt. Hight for a time but not for long), and so South Carter has always been a relatively quiet, lesser-visited peak. Hikers today often remark that while the summit itself is viewless, a short walk north toward Middle Carter yields fine views west to Mount Washington – a rewarding reminder of why even these sub-alpine summits were included in the famous “NH 48” list.
Wildcat Mountain (A Peak) – Wildcat Mountain “A” Peak is a 4,422-foot summit on the east side of Pinkham Notch in Coös County, New Hampshire. It is part of the Carter-Moriah Range of the White Mountains and faces Carter Dome across Carter Notch. Wildcat A is the highest of the multiple summits of Wildcat Mountain, and one of two (along with “D” Peak) that count as official 4,000-footers. The summit of Wildcat A is wooded, but a ledge near the top provides a dramatic overlook of Carter Notch and the steep eastern slopes of Mount Washington. Wildcat Mountain “A” Peak is the highest of the five summits along Wildcat Ridge, which runs on the east side of Pinkham Notch facing Mount Washington. The Wildcats were named for the mountain lions (catamounts) that once roamed these mountains – “wildcat” was a common term in the 19th century for these now-extirpated predators. Early maps label the ridge simply as “Wild Cat.” The peaks are lettered A through E by modern convention, and only Wildcat A and D count as official 4,000-footers (the others are lower). Wildcat A has a wooded summit, but a short distance below it is a ledge with a dramatic overlook of Carter Notch – one of the most famous views in the Whites. This overlook allows one to peer down at the tiny Carter Lake and the AMC’s Carter Notch Hut, with the steep cliffs of Wildcat’s eastern faces and Carter Dome looming opposite. That very scene was a well-known attraction as far back as the 1850s, when adventurers would scramble up from Jackson to peer into the notch. Wildcat A itself doesn’t have roads or buildings, but it has seen its share of trail development: the Wildcat Ridge Trail (now part of the Appalachian Trail) was cut by the AMC in the early 1900s, and the first recorded thru-hike of the Wildcats was in 1911. Logging touched the base of Wildcat in the late 1800s, but its crest remained largely wild. Today, while Wildcat D hosts the ski area infrastructure, Wildcat A remains wild, letting hikers experience a piece of the 19th-century wilderness vista that so impressed those early travelers.
Mount Hancock – Mount Hancock is a 4,420-foot mountain in Grafton County, New Hampshire. The mountain is situated on the southern side of the Pemigewasset Wilderness in the White Mountains. Mount Hancock was named after John Hancock (1737–1793), one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. It is known for its remote location and is often hiked via a loop that also includes its subpeak (South Hancock). The summit of Mount Hancock is forested, with a small outlook near the top that offers views, particularly towards the Osceola range and the heart of the wilderness. Mount Hancock is a remote peak on the southern fringe of the Pemigewasset Wilderness, named in honor of John Hancock (1737–1793), famous signer of the Declaration of Independence and first governor of Massachusetts. The peak was likely named around the 1880s, when a flurry of White Mountain summits were dedicated to Revolutionary-era figures. In the late 19th century, the Hancock area was extremely hard to reach – it wasn’t until the Lincoln Railroad pushed into the East Branch of the Pemigewasset (1890s–1900s) that logging came to Mount Hancock’s valleys. By 1908, lumbermen had built the Hancock Branch Railroad up the North Fork, skirting the base of Hancock; they felled a great deal of timber on its lower slopes. A massive logging camp (Camp 8) sat near the current trailhead. Once the forest was cut, fires sometimes followed – indeed fires burned on neighboring Mount Carrigain in 1907, though Hancock itself escaped a major blaze. As logging ended and the National Forest took over, Mount Hancock returned to quiet. It wasn’t climbed often until after WWII. In 1953, the US Forest Service cut the Hancock Loop Trail to encourage hikers, naming the peak officially (the trail also accesses South Hancock). The summit of Mount Hancock is densely wooded, but a small cleared outlook near the top (created by the trailbuilders) offers views towards the Osceola range and into the heart of the wilderness. These days, hikers tackling Hancock and South Hancock via the loop can still find old railway ties and other traces of J.E. Henry’s logging railroad along the approach – reminders of the mountain’s brief but intense exploitation over a century ago.
South Kinsman Mountain – South Kinsman Mountain is a 4,358-foot mountain in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is the higher of the two main peaks of Kinsman Mountain, which is part of the Kinsman Range in the White Mountains. South Kinsman is the sixth most prominent peak in the White Mountains and marks the highest point between Franconia Notch and Kinsman Notch. The summit is mostly open with scrub vegetation, offering expansive views westward and into the Franconia Range. South Kinsman, together with North Kinsman, is considered one of the New Hampshire 4,000-footers since the two peaks are separated by enough elevation drop to qualify individually. South Kinsman is the higher of the two main peaks of Kinsman Mountain, which straddles the towns of Lincoln and Easton west of Franconia Notch. The Kinsman peaks are named for Nathan Kinsman, an early 19th-century resident of Easton, New Hampshire. The Kinsman family were among the first settlers in that area (Easton was once known as “Kinsman” after Nathan’s family). South Kinsman’s expansive cone is mostly open rock and scrub, offering excellent views westward into Vermont and south along the Blue Ridge of New Hampshire. The mountain also marks the highest point between Franconia Notch and Kinsman Notch. Historically, a bridle path existed in Kinsman Notch as early as the 1830s (the route of today’s Lost River Gorge road), but the Kinsman peaks themselves remained trailless until the early 1900s. In 1902, the AMC constructed the Kinsman Ridge Trail, linking the Kinsmans to Cannon Mountain. South Kinsman was a highlight of this new ridge route. Logging reached high on the mountain’s sides in the late 19th century – especially on the west (Easton) side, where the copper mines of Loon Mountain needed lumber for smelting, and on the east side around Cascade Brook. But the summit ridge’s hardy krummholz was never cut. One interesting historical footnote: in the mid-20th century, the Forest Service considered placing a fire tower on South Kinsman due to its commanding view, but opted for a lower site. Instead, South Kinsman remained wild, and in 1974, the nearby Kinsman Pond Shelter was built to host overnight hikers, reinforcing the peak’s role as a backcountry destination. Today, those who climb South Kinsman can reflect on how the Kinsman name links colonial settler history with the natural history of the mountains.
Mount Field – Mount Field is a 4,340-foot mountain in the Willey Range of the White Mountains, located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It was named in honor of Darby Field, who in 1642 became the first European (recorded) to climb Mount Washington. Mount Field is the highest peak of the Willey Range and is often hiked along with its neighbors Mount Tom and Mount Willey. The summit of Mount Field is wooded, but a short spur path leads to an outlook with views towards Mount Washington and the surrounding area. Mount Field is the highest peak of the Willey Range, situated in the center of Crawford Notch State Park. It was named in honor of Darby Field, who in 1642 became the first European (recorded) to climb Mount Washington. The naming was proposed by 19th-century historians to commemorate Field’s achievement, and the U.S. Geographic Board officially adopted “Mount Field” by the early 1900s. Interestingly, Darby Field likely never climbed Mount Field itself – his route up Washington was from the east – but his surname fits nicely alongside Mount Washington’s other neighboring tributes (like Mount Willey and Mount Tom). Mount Field’s summit is wooded with limited views; however, just below the top a spur path leads to a fine outlook facing Mount Washington. The Willey Range has a poignant history: on the night of August 28, 1826, a catastrophic landslide in Crawford Notch killed the Willey family (for whom nearby Mount Willey is named). That event, which occurred just across the notch, was witnessed by early notch residents and brought national attention to the White Mountains. By the time tourism blossomed in mid-century, trails were being built in this area. In 1845, Professor Edward Tuckerman cut a crude path toward Mount Field’s summit (though it only became popular much later). The current Mount Field summit loop (via the Avalon and Willey Range Trails) was completed by the AMC around 1900. Mount Field also had a fire tower on its summit in the early 1900s – a simple wooden platform on tree stumps – but it was abandoned by the 1940s as visibility was poor due to regrowth. Today, Mount Field is often hiked together with Mount Tom and Mount Willey, offering a journey through history-laden forests that the Crawford and Willey families once knew well.
Mount Osceola – Mount Osceola is a 4,340-foot (1,320 m) peak within the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Located in the White Mountain National Forest (in Grafton County), the mountain is named for Osceola, the early-19th-century Seminole leader. It is the highest peak in the Waterville Valley region. Hikers often climb Mount Osceola via trails from Tripoli Road or from the Greeley Ponds area, and the summit offers fine views to the south and west. (Mount Osceola’s East Peak, at 4,156 feet, is a subordinate summit on the ridge to the northeast.) Mount Osceola is a prominent peak in the Sandwich Range, overlooking the Waterville Valley. It was named for Chief Osceola, the early-19th-century Seminole leader from Florida (born as Billy Powell). The name was likely applied in the mid to late 1800s, during a period when White Mountain surveyors and writers showed a romantic interest in Native American names. (It’s worth noting that Osceola himself never came near New Hampshire, but his name had a popular resonance after the Second Seminole War.) In the early 1900s, the U.S. Forest Service erected a fire lookout tower on Mount Osceola’s summit (around 1910). This tower, later rebuilt in steel, stood for decades as the primary fire-watching station for the southern White Mountains; it was finally removed in 1985 when aerial surveillance and better communication made it obsolete. The old stone tower footings are still visible at the summit, and a large rock cairn now occupies the high point. Mount Osceola was also the site of a small stone shelter (built by the CCC in the 1930s) for use by the fire warden. The mountain’s name and history reflect a blend of cultural homage and practical use. Osceola’s open ledges near the top provide fine views to the south and west, including sights of Lake Winnipesaukee on a clear day. Hikers often climb Osceola from Tripoli Road or via the steep trail from the Greeley Ponds, sometimes continuing over to East Osceola. With the fire tower gone, Mount Osceola today is valued mainly for recreation – though its name still reminds us of a Native American figure known for resistance and resilience, qualities not unfamiliar to those who climb these peaks.
Mount Flume – Mount Flume is a 4,328-foot mountain in the Franconia Range of the White Mountains, lying at the southern end of Franconia Ridge in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It overlooks Franconia Notch and is known for its steep, triangular-shaped summit profile. The summit of Mount Flume is partly open and provides excellent views, especially north along Franconia Ridge to Mount Liberty, Mount Lincoln, and Mount Lafayette, and east into the Pemigewasset Wilderness. It is commonly hiked as part of the Franconia Ridge loop or via the Flume Slide Trail (a very steep route) or the more gradual Osseo Trail. Mount Flume is the southernmost peak on Franconia Ridge, famous for its steep triangular profile and dramatic drop-offs. The mountain gets its name from the Flume Gorge, a spectacular narrow chasm at its north base. The Flume Gorge was accidentally discovered in 1808 by 93-year-old “Aunt” Jess Guernsey while she was fishing. Her discovery quickly became a tourist attraction in the 19th century, and the name “The Flume” was given to the gorge and, by association, to the mountain. (A “flume” in mining parlance is a man-made chute, but here it described a natural water-carved slot through granite.) Before the name Mount Flume took hold, Flume, like Liberty and Lafayette, was considered one of the generic “Haystack” peaks by early settlers. As tourism grew, the distinctive name prevailed. In the late 1800s, the Profile & Franconia Notch Railroad brought visitors to the foot of Mount Flume; from there they could explore the Flume Gorge and even ascend the mountain via bridle path. A path was cut to the summit by the AMC around 1900. Another piece of history: the Flume Slide on Mount Flume’s west face – now a challenging trail route – is a landslide scar possibly created in a huge 1883 rainstorm (the same storm that altered Flume Gorge). Hikers in the early 20th century started ascending via this slide, and it became legendary for its difficulty. Today, Mount Flume is often climbed as part of the Franconia Ridge loop or via the Osseo Trail (built by the CCC in the 1940s). Standing on Flume’s little summit, one can gaze down at the green floor of Franconia Notch and imagine the awe of those first 19th-century tourists who made the trip to see the wonders of the Flume.
South Hancock – South Hancock is a 4,319-foot peak in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is the south peak of Mount Hancock, located in the Pemigewasset Wilderness of the White Mountains. Although it has its own name for listing purposes, South Hancock is a subsidiary summit of Mount Hancock, connected by a ridge and col that drops just over 200 feet, which allows it to qualify as a separate 4,000-footer. The wooded summit of South Hancock offers limited views, but a short distance below the peak there are outlook points with nice views of the Hancock Range and the Arrow Slide on Mount Hancock’s north peak. South Hancock is the southern sub-peak of Mount Hancock, connected to the main summit by a ridge and shallow col. Although it is slightly lower than North (main) Hancock, it qualifies as a separate 4,000-footer due to enough topographic prominence. The peak is named, like its parent mountain, for John Hancock, one of America’s Founding Fathers and the first signer of the Declaration of Independence. The name “Hancock” was assigned to this area by mid-19th-century mapmakers (likely influenced by Surveyor General Philip Carrigain’s 1816 map which marked a “Hancock” in the Whites, though perhaps not exactly on today’s peak). During the great logging era around 1900, the Hancock region was extensively logged by the East Branch & Lincoln Railroad operations. In fact, the saddle between North and South Hancock was completely denuded of trees by J.E. Henry’s timber crews, who then sent logs down the steep south branch via chute to the East Branch river. After the logging, the area was left to recover for decades. A firewarden’s trail was cut up Hancock in the 1940s to watch for fires in the regrowing forest (since a few small fires did ignite in slash around 1947), but no permanent tower was built on Hancock. By the 1970s, the Forest Service established the current Hancock Loop hiking trail. South Hancock’s summit today is wooded and unremarkable (marked by a small sign); however, just a short distance below, along the loop trail, an open spot provides views of the Hancock Range and the scar of the “Arrow Slide” on North Hancock’s face. Those slides are products of the historic torrential rains (likely from the 1927 floods or 1938 hurricane) and serve as natural reminders of the mountain’s dynamic landscape.
Mount Pierce – Mount Pierce is a 4,310-foot mountain in the Presidential Range of the White Mountains, located in Coös County, New Hampshire. Formerly known as Mount Clinton, it was renamed to honor President Franklin Pierce (the only U.S. President from New Hampshire). Mount Pierce is one of the southern Presidentials and has a gentle, open summit with excellent views northward to Mount Washington and the higher Presidentials, as well as westerly views toward the Willey Range. The Appalachian Trail traverses its summit as part of the Crawford Path. Mount Pierce is part of the Presidential Range, formerly known as Mount Clinton. In the 19th century, this peak was named for DeWitt Clinton, a prominent New York politician and governor (1825–1828). However, in 1913 the name was officially changed to honor Franklin Pierce, the 14th President of the United States and the only U.S. President born in New Hampshire. The change was championed by local historians and the Appalachian Mountain Club, and it was timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of Pierce’s birth. Mount Pierce’s history as Mount Clinton included the establishment of the Clinton-Gibbs Trail in the late 1800s (an early route up from Crawford Notch). The mountain’s gentle, open summit has long been a highlight for hikers traversing the Crawford Path, which crosses it. In fact, the Crawford Path – cut in 1819 by Abel and Ethan Crawford – is the oldest continuously maintained hiking trail in America and runs right over Pierce on its way to Mount Washington. Near the summit of Pierce, one can still find the foundation of the old Summit House (a small shelter built in the 1800s for guests traveling the Crawford Path, now gone). When the name changed to Pierce, a new sign was erected, and since then New Hampshire has proudly pointed out that one of its own presidents is represented on the Presidential Range. The views from Pierce, especially toward Mount Washington and Mount Eisenhower, have delighted visitors since the Crawford family used to guide tourists up here on horseback nearly two centuries ago.
North Kinsman Mountain – North Kinsman Mountain is a 4,293-foot peak in the Kinsman Range of the White Mountains, in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is the lower of the two main summits of Kinsman Mountain (South Kinsman being higher). North Kinsman qualifies as a separate 4,000-footer due to the prominence between it and South Kinsman. The summit of North Kinsman is wooded and lacks a view, but a short bushwhack to ledges just east of the top reveals excellent views, including of Kinsman Pond below, South Kinsman nearby, and the opposing Franconia Ridge across the valley. North Kinsman is the lower of the two main Kinsman peaks, located just north of South Kinsman. It qualifies as a separate 4,000-footer due to the substantial drop between the summits. Both Kinsman Mountain peaks are named for Nathan Kinsman, an early settler of the area (specifically, the Kinsman family that settled in Easton, NH in the late 18th century). The name was in local use by the early 1800s; for example, Kinsman Notch to the south appears on maps by 1810, likely referencing the same family. North Kinsman’s summit is wooded and lacks a natural view, but hikers have long ventured a few yards off-trail to an open ledge that reveals a stunning vista. Below lies Kinsman Pond, and across the valley stands Franconia Ridge with the sheer cliffs of Cannon Mountain. This viewspot was known even to 19th-century travelers who took the stage through Franconia Notch – they could look up and see the Kinsman cliffs and slides resulting from early logging. The area around Kinsman Pond was logged around the turn of the 20th century via the Kinsman Notch Railroad (built 1909) and the Kinsman Pond Camps provided shelter for loggers. By 1916, the logging was done and the forest began regrowth under the Forest Service. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps built the first Kinsman Pond Shelter for hikers, establishing North Kinsman as a destination on the AT (the Appalachian Trail ran over Kinsman until the 1950s). Today, North Kinsman sees steady traffic from hikers doing the “Kinsman Ridge Traverse.” While its summit sign and small cairn sit in quiet woods, just a short scramble away one can contemplate two centuries of change – from pioneer homesteads, to logging, to wilderness – all visible in the panorama from that ledge.
Mount Willey – Mount Willey is a 4,285-foot mountain in the Willey Range of the White Mountains, situated in Grafton County, New Hampshire. The mountain is named after Samuel Willey, Jr., whose family tragically died in a landslide in Crawford Notch in 1826. Mount Willey is often hiked in conjunction with Mount Field and Mount Tom. The summit of Mount Willey is mostly wooded, with limited views, but a ledge near the summit offers a dramatic view down into Crawford Notch. The steep western face of Mount Willey drops into the notch and is part of the scenic backdrop seen from the area of the Willey House historic site. Mount Willey is a peak steeped in White Mountain folklore. It is named after Samuel Willey, Jr. and his family, who met tragedy in August 1826 when a massive landslide swept down Mount Willey in Crawford Notch, killing them. The Willeys had fled their house (situated at the notch’s base) during a violent storm, seeking refuge, but were overtaken by the slide. Ironically, the house itself was spared – a large rocky island split the slide – but the family perished. This event received widespread publicity (even noted by Henry Thoreau later) and ushered in the era of tourism in the White Mountains. The mountain was subsequently named for the Willeys, immortalizing their story. In the mid-19th century, a small inn and later the Willey House site became a tourist attraction, with visitors coming to see the site of the tragedy. Trail-building on Mount Willey followed: by the 1850s, the notch’s proprietors had blazed a path partway up. The Willey Range Trail as we know it was largely completed by the AMC in the 1930s. The summit of Mount Willey is mostly wooded, but a short side spur leads to a dramatic cliff viewpoint. That cliff plunges directly into Crawford Notch, giving a heart-stopping view down to the site of the Willey House (now a picnic area/museum). One can imagine the slide of 1826 roaring down those slopes. Mount Willey is often hiked in conjunction with Mount Field and Mount Tom, forming a loop from the historic Crawford Depot. Fittingly, this loop traces routes that 19th-century visitors (including artists like Thomas Cole) traveled on foot or horseback as they paid homage to the legend of the Willey Family and the sublime power of White Mountain nature.
Bondcliff – Bondcliff is a 4,265-foot peak in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. It is a subsidiary ridge summit of Mount Bond and is one of the trio of peaks known as The Bonds in the heart of the Pemigewasset Wilderness. Bondcliff is known for its dramatic cliffs along the ridgeline and its sense of remoteness. The summit is above treeline and offers spectacular panoramic views, especially of the neighboring peaks Mount Bond and West Bond and across the wilderness towards Owl’s Head and Franconia Ridge. Bondcliff, like Mount Bond and West Bond, is reached by a long approach and is often hiked as part of an extended loop or traverse. Bondcliff is the southernmost of “The Bonds,” a trio of peaks at the heart of the Pemigewasset Wilderness. It is essentially the long southern ridge of Mount Bond, terminating in sheer cliffs that drop hundreds of feet – one of the most dramatic natural features in New England. Bondcliff is named in conjunction with Mount Bond, thus inheriting the dedication to Professor George P. Bond. In early AMC literature, this peak was sometimes called “The Cliff of Mt. Bond” or simply “Bond’s Cliff.” The first recorded ascent of Bondcliff was likely in the 1880s by AMC explorers like Charles E. Lowe during the survey of the area. By the late 1890s, the Zealand Valley Railroad and the East Branch & Lincoln Railroad had encircled Bondcliff’s flanks, meeting at Camp 17 near today’s Bondcliff Trail terminus. Lumbermen clear-cut the valleys (Hellgate Brook, Black Brook) on both sides of Bondcliff. After logging ceased (circa 1900–1910), wildfires scorched parts of the region and then nature slowly rebounded. In 1964, the Bondcliff area was part of the first wilderness designated in the eastern US (Pemigewasset Wilderness precursor under the Wilderness Act), and in 1984 it gained further protection. Because it is so remote, Bondcliff has always been revered by the hiking community. A trail (the Bondcliff Trail) was cut by the AMC in 1948 along the old railroad bed and up the ridge, making access a bit easier. Bondcliff’s summit, marked by a small cairn, offers spectacular panoramic views – especially back north to Mount Bond and West Bond, and across the wilderness toward Franconia Ridge and Owl’s Head. Many a White Mountain devotee has captured the iconic photograph of a companion standing on the famous jutting ledge on Bondcliff’s ridge, a pose that symbolizes the freedom and wildness of these mountains.
Zealand Mountain – Zealand Mountain (sometimes called Mount Zealand) is a 4,260-foot mountain located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It stands on the northwestern side of the Pemigewasset Wilderness and is part of the Twin Range of the White Mountains. The summit area is densely wooded and viewless, marked by a small cairn. Zealand Mountain is known for its remote location and is often accessed via the Zealand Trail and Twinway (which passes by Zealand Falls and Zealand Hut). Although the summit itself has no views, nearby outlooks on Zeacliff along the approach offer stunning views of the Zealand Valley and surrounding peaks. Zealand Mountain is a peak hidden in the deep forests on the northwestern side of the Pemigewasset Wilderness. Its name “Zealand” originates from a 19th-century logging community that once thrived in the valley north of the mountain. Zealand village was established around 1880 by timber baron J.E. Henry in the town of Carroll. At its height, Zealand had a huge steam-powered sawmill (200 hp), a company town with homes, a store, a school, and two railroad lines servicing it – the Zealand Valley Railroad (1885–1897) and a connection to the Boston & Maine line. The village’s name may have been inspired by New Zealand or perhaps simply chosen as a unique moniker by Henry (some speculate it was named after a horse or a fanciful marketing idea). Logging operations clear-cut the forests around Zealand Mountain in the 1880s and 1890s. Two enormous forest fires (in 1886 and 1897) ravaged the cut-over land, even destroying much of the village in 1897. By 1900, the remaining timber was gone, the railroad was abandoned, and Zealand village faded into history. Today, near the site, the Zealand Trail leads hikers past cellar holes and along the old railroad grade. Zealand Mountain’s summit itself is marked by a small cairn in dense spruce – with no views – a quiet memorial to the wild land it has become again. Many hikers reach it via the Twinway after enjoying the spectacular vista from Zeacliff, which overlooks the rehabilitated Zealand Valley. Fittingly, the name “Zealand” – once associated with industry and devastation – is now synonymous with one of the most pristine corners of the Whites, showcasing the success of forest conservation and regrowth.
North Tripyramid – Mount Tripyramid (North Peak) is one of the three summits of Mount Tripyramid in the Sandwich Range of the White Mountains. The North Peak stands at 4,180 feet (1,274 m), making it the highest of the Tripyramid trio. It is located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. North Tripyramid, along with Middle Tripyramid, is included on the Appalachian Mountain Club’s list of 4,000-footers. The two peaks are connected by a ridge and separated by a deep col. The summit of North Tripyramid is wooded, but a hike up its steep North Slide (for experienced hikers) or the gentler approach from the south provides views along the way, and there are limited outlooks near the summit itself. North Tripyramid is the highest of the three summits of Mount Tripyramid in the Sandwich Range. The Tripyramids get their collective name from their three distinct cone-shaped peaks, which resemble a cluster of pyramids rising from the forest. The naming is credited to Arnold Guyot, a prominent 19th-century geographer and cartographer, who systematically surveyed the White Mountains in the 1850s and bestowed many of their names. Guyot named these peaks “Tripyramid” due to their tri-peaked form. North Tripyramid, being the tallest, stands at 4,180 feet and is included on the AMC’s official 4,000-footer list along with Middle Tripyramid. The area around the Tripyramids has a history of logging and natural landslides. In August 1885 (and again in 1892), heavy rains triggered landslides on the north side of North Tripyramid, creating the now-famous North Slide (and similarly, the South Slide on the south side in 1869). These slides were notable enough to be mentioned in early trail reports, and by the early 1900s hikers were using them as adventurous routes. The Livermore brothers ran logging operations on Tripyramid’s lower slopes (1890s), using a series of switchback logging railroads – remnants of which hikers still encounter, such as the grade in Livermore that the Mount Tripyramid Trail follows. By 1916, as logging waned, the WMNF took over and the area gradually returned to wilderness. North Tripyramid’s summit is densely wooded, so historically it was not a site for fire towers or structures. However, one tangible bit of history is an old blaze at the top marking the junction of paths laid out by the AMC in the 1920s. Those trails remain, guiding modern hikers up the same steep slides that early mountaineers tackled with alpenstocks and hobnailed boots.
Mount Cabot – Mount Cabot is a 4,170-foot mountain located in Coös County, New Hampshire. It is the highest peak in the Pilot Range of the White Mountains and the northernmost of New Hampshire’s 48 four-thousand footers. Mount Cabot is named (indirectly) for the Cabot family or possibly the explorer John Cabot, and it lies within the Kilkenny region of the White Mountain National Forest. The mountain is heavily forested. Its summit has a clearing (where a fire lookout tower once stood) but only obstructed views; however, nearby viewpoints on the trail, such as Bunnell Rock, offer nice vistas to the south and east. Mount Cabot is the highest peak of the Pilot Range and the northernmost of New Hampshire’s 48 four-thousand footers. The mountain was named for the Cabot family, specifically referencing either the explorer John Cabot or (more commonly asserted) his son Sebastian Cabot, who was a famous navigator in his own right. The Cabot name was likely applied by 19th-century mapmakers to honor the early explorers of North America (much as nearby peaks like Columbus, Franklin, etc., have exploratory or patriotic names). Mount Cabot lies in a region that was once quite remote from tourist influence. However, even this far north, logging had an impact. In the late 19th century, the Kilkenny Lumber Company built logging camps on Cabot’s slopes, and by the early 20th century the Berlin Lumber Company was active to the east. A logging railroad (the Randolph & Pleasant Valley) edged near the base of Cabot around 1912. The summit ridge of Cabot was never logged due to its inaccessible height, and so by the 1920s it made a prime location for a fire lookout. In 1924, the Forest Service built a small fire lookout cabin near Mount Cabot’s summit (just a few yards below the high point on the west side). They also erected a steel fire tower. The tower stood for several decades but was removed by the 1960s. The cabin still remains and is now maintained as an overnight shelter for hikers – one of the few surviving original fire warden’s cabins in the Whites. Because of its northern location, Mount Cabot wasn’t officially added to the AMC 4,000-footer list until later (it was recognized by the AMC in the 1950s). Its summit is marked by a clearing where the tower once stood, but trees have since grown to obscure the once-impressive view. Nevertheless, an outlook at Bunnell Rock on the trail up provides a beautiful vista across the North Country. Mount Cabot’s legacy is a blend of exploration history (with the Cabot name), conservation (it anchors the Pilot Range within the National Forest), and the bygone era of solitary fire watchers scanning the horizon from its top.
East Osceola – Mount Osceola, East Peak (often simply called East Osceola) is a 4,156-foot mountain in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. It is a subordinate peak of Mount Osceola, located to the east of Osceola’s main summit along the ridge in the town of Lincoln (Grafton County). East Osceola is reached via the Greeley Pond Trail and Mount Osceola Trail, typically on the way to or from the main summit of Mount Osceola. The summit of East Osceola is wooded and marked by a cairn, offering little in terms of views. Despite its lack of vistas, it counts as a separate 4,000-footer due to the prominence drop between it and Mount Osceola. East Osceola is a subsidiary peak on the ridge extending east from Mount Osceola, located in the town of Lincoln. With an elevation just over 4,150 feet, it barely qualifies as a 4,000-footer due to a prominence of about 316 feet from the main summit. East Osceola’s lack of a distinct historical identity reflects its nature – it is essentially the eastern shoulder of Mount Osceola. The peak’s name simply comes from its relationship to Osceola; maps list it as “Mount Osceola, East Peak.” It carries the same namesake as the main mountain: Chief Osceola of the Seminole tribe. There are no separate naming ceremonies or legends specifically tied to East Osceola. Historically, East Osceola’s steep, wooded slopes were logged during the late 19th-century when the Woodstock Lumber Company built a branch off the Pemigewasset Valley Railroad up the Pine Brook valley. A logging camp once existed near the col between East Osceola and Mount Osceola. By the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps had created the Greeley Ponds Trail and Osceola Trail, establishing a hiking route over East Osceola. The summit is wooded and marked by a small rock cairn – it offers no views, which perhaps explains why no fire tower was ever built here (the fire tower was on the higher main Osceola). In recent times, East Osceola gained a bit of notoriety among peak-baggers for the challenging climb up its western flank: the trail from Greeley Ponds ascends a very steep slide (often icy in spring) that tests hikers’ mettle. Other than serving as a waypoint for determined hikers en route to or from Mount Osceola, East Osceola remains a quiet, forest-clad bump that lets you experience the deep woods solitude characteristic of the Sandwich Range.
Middle Tripyramid – Mount Tripyramid, Middle Peak is a 4,140-foot summit in the Sandwich Range of the White Mountains, located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is the middle of the three Tripyramid peaks and the second-highest (after North Tripyramid). Middle Tripyramid is also included in the official 4,000-footers list. Like North Tripyramid, its summit is wooded with no direct views. The peaks are often hiked together via the Mt. Tripyramid Trail (which ascends the steep North Slide and descends the South Slide), and hikers can find good views from the slide areas or from Scaur Ridge nearby. Middle Tripyramid just meets the prominence requirement above the col with North Tripyramid to count as a distinct summit. Middle Tripyramid is the middle summit of Mount Tripyramid’s trio of peaks and the second-highest of the three. Like North Tripyramid, its name was given by Professor Arnold Guyot during his extensive survey of the White Mountains in the 1850s. Guyot named numerous peaks (including the neighboring Mount Carrigain, Mount Lafayette’s alternate name North & South Peaks, etc.), and for Tripyramid he used a straightforward descriptive approach. The name “Tripyramid” first appears in print on Guyot’s 1860s maps, solidifying these labels. Middle Tripyramid is densely wooded on top and has no view, which has meant little human development on the peak itself. The history of the Tripyramid area is largely a tale of logging and nature’s reclamation. In the late 1800s, the immense Livermore Logging Operation was active to the south of Tripyramid. The Tripyramid Slide of 1869 on the south side (visible from Waterville) was possibly triggered by heavy rains during that period of logging. Middle Tripyramid stands between the two large slide scars (North Slide and South Slide) that have become geological landmarks. Early hikers—members of the AMC in the 1870s and 1880s—explored these slides; one account from 1886 describes an intrepid descent of the South Slide “over loose rock and gravel.” The first formal trail across Middle Tripyramid was part of the Tri-Path created in 1899 linking all three summits. In the early 20th century, as the forests regrew, the slides remained open, providing the best views of the range’s interior. Middle Tripyramid just meets the prominence requirement to count as a distinct summit, which is why it’s on the official list. As such, many peak-baggers visit it specifically. Other than that, Middle Tripyramid’s summit might be one of the most inconspicuous of the 48 – only a small sign and canister used to mark it (the canister, a relic of the older peak-bagging verification system, has since been removed). Hiking Middle Tripyramid today, one passes through forests that hide the past scars of logging railroads and witness the enduring regeneration of these ancient Appalachian slopes.
Cannon Mountain – Cannon Mountain is a 4,100-foot (1,249 m) mountain located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is situated at the northern end of the Franconia Range, overlooking Franconia Notch. Cannon Mountain is known for its nearly vertical east face of cliffs (the site of the former Old Man of the Mountain rock profile) and for the Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway, which carries visitors to near its summit. The mountain is a popular destination for both hiking and skiing (home to Cannon Mountain Ski Area). At the summit, an observation tower provides excellent views of Franconia Notch, the Kinsman Range, and the surrounding White Mountains. Cannon Mountain stands at the northern end of Franconia Notch and is famous for its near-vertical east face of cliffs. Historically, the mountain was often called Profile Mountain because it was home to the Old Man of the Mountain, the iconic granite profile that for centuries jutted from Cannon’s cliffs. The Old Man formation was first noticed by surveyors around 1805, and it became a symbol of New Hampshire (eventually being chosen as the state emblem). Tourists flocked to see it throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Sadly, on May 3, 2003, the Old Man of the Mountain collapsed and fell from the cliff, despite efforts to secure it. The loss was widely mourned, but the site remains a pilgrimage spot with a memorial. Aside from its natural profile, Cannon Mountain made history in another way: it was the site of North America’s first passenger aerial tramway, opened in 1938. The Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway was a marvel of its time – built to whisk visitors (especially skiers) to the summit. Its grand opening drew thousands, and it operated (with upgrades) for over 80 years. The original 1938 car, which carried 27 passengers, was replaced in 1980 by a larger tram (Tram II) holding 70, and Cannon is now working on a third-generation tram. The presence of the tram spurred the development of Cannon as a ski area post-WWII, including trails cut by the CCC. Interestingly, before the tram’s existence, a carriage road was planned for Cannon in the 1850s but never built – instead, the Profile House hotel at the base would guide adventurous guests up on foot or horseback. Cannon’s summit also hosted an observation tower from the 1930s onward (the modern one gives a superb 360° view). Cannon Mountain thus has a dual legacy: geological icon (the Old Man) and engineering icon (the tramway). It remains a centerpiece of Franconia Notch State Park, combining natural beauty with historic innovation.
Mount Hale – Mount Hale is a 4,054-foot mountain in Grafton County, New Hampshire. The mountain is part of the Twin Range of the White Mountains and is situated in the Bethlehem area within the White Mountain National Forest. Mount Hale was named after Reverend Edward Everett Hale (1822–1909). Its summit is wooded and capped by a large rock pile left from a former fire tower. Because of the tree cover, there are no sweeping views at the very top, but limited outlooks can be found on the trail during the ascent. Mount Hale is considered one of the shorter and easier 4,000-footer hikes, often climbed from the Zealand Road area. Mount Hale is a lesser-known 4,000-footer located in the Twin Range, within Bethlehem township. It was named for Reverend Edward Everett Hale (1822–1909), a prominent clergyman and author. (Edward Everett Hale is remembered for works like the 1863 story “The Man Without a Country,” and he was also Chaplain of the U.S. Senate. The mountain’s name was conferred in the early 1900s, likely soon after Hale’s death, by the AMC to honor him.) Mount Hale’s summit was once the site of a fire lookout tower, built in 1928–29 by the Forest Service. The wooden tower and a warden’s cabin stood on the summit clearing for several decades. The tower was manned during the big fire years of the 1930s and 1940s but was taken out of service in 1948. Eventually, in 1972, the decaying tower was removed entirely (the cabin had been gone earlier). Today all that remains is the large rock pile that was the base for the tower – hikers often climb it to get a limited view above the treetops. Before the establishment of the National Forest, the Hale area saw logging by the Zealand Valley operations (J.E. Henry) in the 1890s and later by Parker-Young Company in the 1910s. An old logging railroad (Zealand Valley R.R.) ran close to Mount Hale’s base. The creation of the Zealand Trail and Lend-a-Hand Trail by the AMC (in the 1930s) turned Mount Hale into a hiking objective. It’s considered one of the shorter/easier 4,000-footers, yet it holds a bit of mystery: because the summit is wooded with no views, it’s one of those peaks people climb mainly “because it’s there” on the list. In recent years, there was even an effort to measure Hale’s exact height with modern GPS – confirming it still exceeded 4,000 feet. Regardless of its modesty, Mount Hale’s historical footnote as a once-important fire lookout and its connection to a famous writer give it a quiet dignity.
Mount Jackson – Mount Jackson is a mountain in Coös County, New Hampshire. The mountain is named after Charles Thomas Jackson, a 19th-century state geologist, and is part of the Presidential Range of the White Mountains. Mount Jackson has an elevation of 4,052 feet and is located at the southern end of the Presidentials. It is flanked to the north by Mount Pierce and to the southwest by Mount Webster. The summit of Mount Jackson is open and ledgy, offering nice views, especially of the southern Presidential Range and Crawford Notch. The Appalachian Trail crosses its summit as it traverses between Crawford Notch and the higher Presidentials. Mount Jackson is a mountain at the southern end of the Presidential Range, and despite its presidential-sounding name, it is not named after President Andrew Jackson. It actually honors Charles Thomas Jackson, a 19th-century geologist and surveyor. Charles T. Jackson was the New Hampshire State Geologist (he published a comprehensive report on NH’s geology in 1844) and also did surveys of Maine and Rhode Island. The peak received his name in recognition of his scientific contributions to the region. Mount Jackson’s summit is open and ledgy, with excellent views of the higher Presidentials to the north and Crawford Notch to the south. Historically, the Crawford family (whose lands encompassed this area) guided tourists up Jackson as early as the 1850s. Back then, it was sometimes called “Hart’s Ledge” or “Tin Mine Mountain” (there were early 19th-century tin mining explorations on its slopes). The official naming for Jackson happened in the 1850s when Arnold Guyot and others standardized the Presidential Range’s monikers (some sources indicate it was named by Edward Tuckerman around 1853 for the geologist Jackson). An interesting historical anecdote: in 1858, Henry David Thoreau climbed Mount Jackson (he referred to it as “Mount Pleasant” erroneously in his journal) and described the stunning view of Mount Washington’s snowy summit. In terms of trails, the Webster-Jackson Trail was built in 1849, making it among the oldest recreational trails in the Whites. During the late 1800s, the summit of Jackson even featured a small wooden observation platform, built by AMC members to aid in identifying peaks – long gone now. Mount Jackson is also crossed by the Appalachian Trail, and during the AT’s establishment in the 1930s, CCC crews improved the trails over Jackson. Today, thousands of AT thru-hikers and day-hikers alike stand on Mount Jackson’s breezy summit, perhaps unaware of Dr. Charles Jackson’s legacy but certainly appreciative of the mountain that bears his name and offers such a splendid panorama.
Mount Tom – Mount Tom is a 4,052-foot mountain in the Willey Range of the White Mountains, located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It was named for Thomas Crawford, a 19th-century innkeeper of Crawford Notch (and part of the family for whom Crawford Notch is named). Mount Tom is often hiked together with neighboring Mount Field and Mount Willey. The summit of Mount Tom is forested with no direct views, but just below the summit, hikers can find viewpoints that offer vistas toward the Presidential Range and down into Crawford Notch. A notable feature on its slopes is the bird population; Mount Tom is known as a good place to spot Canada jays near the summit. Mount Tom is one of three 4,000-foot peaks in the Willey Range (along with Field and Willey). It was named for Thomas Crawford, a 19th-century innkeeper and guide, and son of Abel Crawford. The Crawford family were legendary in White Mountain history: Abel Crawford blazed the Crawford Path over the Presidentials in 1819, and his son Ethan Crawford built the original inn in Crawford Notch. Thomas (often called Tom) Crawford ran the Notch House hotel starting in 1828, near the dramatic entrance to Crawford Notch (at a site called the Gate of the Notch, by the Elephant Head rock formation). He catered to early tourists and helped cut bridle paths in the area. By giving Mount Tom its name, local hikers and mapmakers honored his contributions. (Coincidentally, “Tom” also aligns with the Crawford family tradition of biblical names – Abel, Ethan – but in this case it’s indeed for Thomas.) Mount Tom’s summit is forested, so no grand hotel or tower was ever built there. However, the Crawford family did create a path to Mount Tom’s summit in the 1840s as part of their guided excursions for guests – making it one of the older recreational routes. Later, in 1875, a Professor J. Rayner Edmands (famous trail-builder) improved the trail. Today’s Mount Tom Spur off the A-Z Trail traces near that old route. As part of the Crawford Notch State Park, logging was minimal on Mount Tom (the Crawford family protected their notch scenery). One quirky historical relic on Mount Tom’s slopes: near its summit, hikers often encounter remarkably tame gray jays (also known as Canada jays). These birds have been noted in journals as far back as the 1800s – the Crawfords themselves likely fed them to entertain guests. Mount Tom’s close association with the early hospitality industry of the Whites, and with the enduring natural charm of friendly summit jays, makes it an unsung but delightful peak. Hikers often combine it with Field and Willey, traversing the same ridge that Thomas Crawford himself once guided visitors along, nearly two centuries ago.
Mount Moriah – Mount Moriah is a 4,049-foot mountain in Coös County, New Hampshire. It is the northernmost peak on the Appalachian Mountain Club’s list of 4,000-footers in the White Mountains. Mount Moriah is part of the Carter-Moriah Range and stands to the northeast of Pinkham Notch, overlooking the town of Gorham. The summit, reached via the Carter-Moriah Trail (which is also the Appalachian Trail in this section), consists of open ledges that provide excellent views. From Mount Moriah’s summit one can see the Presidential Range to the west, as well as the Carter Range and the Wild River Wilderness. The mountain’s name comes from the Bible (likely named by 19th-century mapmakers), keeping with the theme after nearby Mount Zion and the town of Bethel, Maine to the east. Mount Moriah stands at the northeast end of the Carter-Moriah Range, overlooking the town of Gorham and the Androscoggin valley. Its name has biblical origins: “Mount Moriah” is referenced in the Bible as the mountain where Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac, and later one of the hills on which Jerusalem was built. The peak’s naming likely occurred in the mid-1800s, when it became fashionable to use biblical and classical names in the White Mountains (nearby Imp Mountain was once called Mount Zion, and there is a Mount Abram and a Jerusalem Valley in the vicinity). According to local legend, a deeply religious early settler or mapmaker chose the name Moriah to go along with the theme of “holy land” names after seeing the sun’s rays break through clouds on the summit – an almost divine spectacle. While the precise story is unconfirmed, the legend has become the accepted lore. In the late 19th century, logging encroached on Moriah from the east (the Wild River logging railroad) and from the north (Berlin Mills operations), but the summit cone was spared. Around 1881, AMC trail-builders led by George Van Nostrand cut the Carter-Moriah Trail from Gorham to the summit, making it one of the earlier White Mountain recreational paths. This route was later incorporated into the Appalachian Trail, and Moriah became (and remains) the northernmost NH 4,000-footer on the AT. In terms of structures, Mount Moriah never had a fire tower – the nearby Mount Surprise had a fire lookout instead. However, Moriah’s summit did see a shelter: in 1933 the AMC built Ralph’s Vista Shelter just below the summit for AT hikers (it was removed in the 1950s). Today, Mount Moriah’s open ledge summit provides excellent views – you can see the Presidential Range to the west and the wilds of the Carter-Wild River region all around. The mountain’s mix of cultural naming and natural beauty encapsulates how 19th-century perceptions of the White Mountains often intertwined religious reverence with the awe of nature.
Mount Passaconaway – Mount Passaconaway is a 4,043-foot mountain in the Sandwich Range, located in Grafton County (town of Waterville Valley), New Hampshire. The mountain is named after Passaconaway, a legendary 17th-century sachem (chief) of the Pennacook people. Mount Passaconaway is densely wooded on top; its summit is tree-covered with a small cairn marking the high point. Although the summit itself has no view, a short spur path leads to a clearing with an excellent southward outlook. Mount Passaconaway is often hiked along with neighboring Mount Whiteface, and it is known for its steep, challenging ascents (such as via the Dicey’s Mill Trail or the Walden Trail) and for the wilderness feel of the Bowl Research Natural Area on its eastern flank. Mount Passaconaway is a prominent peak in the Sandwich Range Wilderness, named after Chief Passaconaway, the great 17th-century sachem of the Pennacook people. Passaconaway (whose name means “Child of the Bear”) was a legendary figure in New England lore; he is said to have been a powerful shaman who united several tribes in peace and possibly met with early Massachusetts colonists. According to one popular legend, Passaconaway, at the end of his life, ascended a high summit (some versions say Mount Washington, others say Mount Agamenticus or even this mountain) and rode off into the sky on a sled pulled by wolves, bidding farewell to his people. Such stories, though apocryphal, added a mystique to the mountain’s name among white settlers. The mountain was likely named by Dartmouth professor Edward Tuckerman or one of his contemporaries around the 1820s, as part of a burst of interest in Native American names (nearby Mount Chocorua and Mount Kancamagus similarly honor local chiefs). Mount Passaconaway’s steep, wooded slopes remained a stronghold of old-growth forest well into the logging era. One area on its eastern side, The Bowl, was never logged due to its inaccessible basin – it contains virgin spruce forest to this day, designated as a Research Natural Area. Logging did occur on Passaconaway’s lower slopes (the Swift River Railroad reached its south side in the 1890s), but higher elevations were largely spared. In 1891, the Wonalancet Outdoor Club cut the first trail to the summit (the Dicey’s Mill Trail, named after an old sawmill). In the late 1800s and early 1900s, hikers could stay at the Passaconaway Lodge in Wonalancet village and hire guides for the climb. Although the summit of Passaconaway is wooded with no view, a short spur leads to a south outlook known as Nanamocomuck’s Ledge (Nanamocomuck was Passaconaway’s son), which provides a stunning vista over Lake Winnipesaukee and the Ossipee Range. In all, Mount Passaconaway’s rich tapestry of Native American history and 19th-century hiking culture makes it a particularly fascinating peak – one where the echoes of indigenous legend and the footprints of early Appalachian Mountain Club explorers can both be imagined as you stand among its quiet trees.
Owl’s Head – Owl’s Head is a 4,025-foot mountain deep in the Pemigewasset Wilderness of the White Mountains, in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is one of the more remote and challenging peaks on the NH 4,000-footers list to reach, as there is no official trail all the way to the summit (hikers follow unofficial herd paths up a steep slide and through dense woods). The mountain is named for a distinctive rock outcropping on its western side that is said to resemble the profile of an owl’s head. Owl’s Head’s summit is wooded and viewless, but along the ascent of the Owl’s Head slide there are impressive views of the surrounding peaks, including Franconia Ridge to the west and the Bonds to the east. This peak’s isolation and difficult access make it an infamous checkmark for peak-baggers. Owl’s Head is a remote mountain deep in the Pemigewasset Wilderness, notorious among hikers for its long, trailless approach and viewless summit. The mountain earned its name from a rock formation on its western side that, when viewed from across the valley (particularly from Franconia Ridge or near the Lincoln Brook Trail), resembles the profile of an owl’s head – complete with “eye” and “beak” features. This distinctive cliff profile was noted by surveyors as early as the 1800s and the name “Owl’s Head” was in use by the time the 1853 state map was published. Historically, the Owl’s Head area was untouched wilderness until the late 19th century, when J.E. Henry’s logging operations pushed into the heart of the Pemi. Around 1894, the Lincoln Lumber Company built the Lincoln Brook Railroad spur, which ran right along the base of Owl’s Head (traces of it coincide with today’s Lincoln Brook Trail). Loggers clear-cut vast stands of spruce and fir around the mountain between 1894 and 1896. On August 1907, a fierce lightning-sparked wildfire roared through the previously logged slash on Owl’s Head’s east side. The fire, fed by debris left by Henry’s crews, burned thousands of acres and was one of several catastrophic fires that year. It was a stark example of the destruction that helped prompt the creation of the National Forest in 1911. After logging ceased, no trails were built to the summit for decades. Owl’s Head was somewhat forgotten until the peak-bagging movement after WWII. In the 1950s, when the AMC drew up the official 4,000-footer list, they included Owl’s Head – and adventurers started bushwhacking to the top. A makeshift herd path developed along the Owl’s Head Slide, the scar of a long-ago landslide on the west side that provides the only semblance of a view on the way up. For many years, there was a debate about the exact location of the high point (and indeed, around 2005, surveyors confirmed the true summit is a bit north of where the old cairn was, causing hundreds of “grid” hikers to re-climb it). Now a small cairn marks the true summit in the woods. There are no signs (consistent with wilderness regulations). Climbing Owl’s Head today, one encounters no man-made structures – just a rough footway and perhaps the ghosts of logging locomotives and fire patrols in the valleys below. It exemplifies wilderness restoration: once ravaged and burnt, now again a green, trackless mountain where an owl (or a hiker seeking solitude) might find a quiet home.
Mount Whiteface – Mount Whiteface is a 4,020-foot mountain in the Sandwich Range of the White Mountains, straddling the border of Grafton and Carroll counties in New Hampshire. The mountain is named for the large white granite cliff on its southeast face. Mount Whiteface’s summit is wooded and marked by a cairn just off the trail with limited views, but just below the summit, open ledges on the Blueberry Ledge Trail provide expansive views south and east, including Lake Winnipesaukee and the Ossipee Range. Mount Whiteface is often climbed together with Mount Passaconaway to its north, and both peaks lie within the White Mountain National Forest’s Sandwich Range Wilderness. Mount Whiteface is a prominent peak in the Sandwich Range on the southern edge of the White Mountain region. The mountain takes its name from the large, pale granite cliff on its southeastern face – a feature so conspicuous that early settlers in the region referred to the mountain simply as “White Face.” The cliff, visible for miles (including from Lake Winnipesaukee), was a landmark for Native Americans and colonists traveling through the area. Mount Whiteface’s summit is wooded and marked by a modest cairn just off the trail, but just below the summit are open ledges (along the Blueberry Ledge Trail) that provide expansive views south and east, including Lake Winnipesaukee and the Ossipee Range. Historically, the Sandwich Range was one of the last sections of the White Mountains to be developed: in 1876 the “Sandwich and Waterville Railroad” was chartered but never built, so logging remained horse-and-sled based and was patchy. Some logging occurred around Whiteface in the late 1800s (especially the Drakes Brook drainage), but the steep cliffs protected much of the upper mountain. The area between Whiteface and Passaconaway, known as “The Bowl,” was never logged and today is an old-growth forest preserve. The first known ascent of Mount Whiteface was by Professor J.S. Woodman in 1832; he was scouting a route for a road (which never materialized). The Appalachian Mountain Club built the Blueberry Ledge Trail in 1899, opening the summit to hikers. At the same time, the Wonalancet Outdoor Club (founded 1892) created a network of trails on the mountain’s southern side. An interesting bit of human history on Whiteface: near the mountain’s foot was the homestead of Samuel “Sam” Livermore, a 19th-century hermit who lived there for 14 years (1820s–1830s) and claimed to have visions on the mountain – he’s sometimes called the “Sage of Whiteface.” Today, Mount Whiteface lies within the federally designated Sandwich Range Wilderness (since 1984), ensuring its cliffs and forests remain untouched. Hikers often combine Whiteface with Passaconaway in a single day – a route that traces the circumference of The Bowl. They may not realize it, but by doing so they circumnavigate one of New England’s most significant tracts of virgin timber, gazing out from Whiteface’s ledges on a landscape that, except for the absence of wolves and presence of distant farms, looks much as it did centuries ago.
Mount Waumbek – Mount Waumbek is a 4,006-foot mountain in Coös County, New Hampshire. It is part of the Pliny Range in the northern White Mountains and is the third-highest peak in that range (after Mount Starr King, which is on the same ridge, and Mount Cabot to the east). Mount Waumbek is typically hiked via a trail that passes over Mount Starr King. The summit of Waumbek is wooded, with a limited clearing that provides a restricted view towards the Presidential Range. Being one of the northernmost 4,000-footers, Mount Waumbek is often one of the last peaks hikers climb to complete the NH48 list. The mountain’s name “Waumbek” comes from an Abenaki word, often interpreted to mean “white rock” or “snowy” (perhaps referencing its snowy winters). Mount Waumbek is a peak in the Pliny Range of northern New Hampshire, and it is the third-highest peak in that range (after two unnamed points on neighboring Mount Starr King’s ridge). The name “Waumbek” is of Abenaki origin, and it’s often said to mean “white rock” or “snowy mountain.” In fact, the Abenaki referred to the entire White Mountains range as “Wôbanakik” or specifically called the Presidential peaks Waumbek Methna (“Snowy Foreheads”). The term waumbik in Algonquian can mean “white (rock)”, likely referencing the lighter-colored granite or the snow that caps these peaks. Over time, the name Waumbek came to be attached to this specific mountain, perhaps through early map usage in the 19th century (it appears on maps by 1853). In the 1800s, the Pliny Range was largely inaccessible wilderness, but one event put Waumbek on the map of history: around 1808, a road (the Starr King road) was cut nearby, and settlers moved into Jefferson, NH. In 1882, in the spirit of the tourism boom, the Star King Hotel opened in Jefferson and began offering guided hikes up Mount Waumbek via Starr King. Hikers could ride burros partway and then hike – it was quite an adventure. The mountain was appealing for its views of the Presidential Range. The fire lookout era touched Waumbek as well: around 1911, a crude log fire tower was built on Mount Starr King (the peak one must cross on the way to Waumbek). Later, in the 1930s, the CCC improved it to a steel tower. While that tower was removed in the 1960s, the old warden’s cabin (built 1939) still sits on Starr King’s summit, slowly deteriorating. Mount Waumbek’s summit itself is wooded and had no structures, but a small clearing just beyond the high point provides a framed western view – notably, it often showcases the snow-capped Presidentials in winter, a fitting tribute to the name “Waumbek.” Among peakbaggers, Waumbek has a bit of a reputation as being “anti-climactic” as the last of the NH48 (since its summit is forested). In fact, many hikers do choose Waumbek as their final peak when finishing the 48, precisely for that relaxed finish. On such occasions, the summit might not be visually dramatic, but the knowledge of Waumbek’s Abenaki roots and the realization that one stands on a mountain named “Snowy Forehead” – with Mt. Washington’s snowy cap often visible – gives the moment a special cultural resonance.
Mount Isolation – Mount Isolation is a 4,004-foot mountain in Coös County, New Hampshire. True to its name, it is one of the most isolated peaks in the White Mountains, situated in the Dry River Wilderness area at the southern end of the Presidential Range. Mount Isolation is the highest summit on the Montalban Ridge, which extends south from Mount Washington. Hiking to Mount Isolation requires a long journey (generally 12–14 miles round trip), often via Glen Boulder Trail and Davis Path or Rocky Branch Trail and Isolation Trail. The summit of Mount Isolation has an open ledge that yields outstanding views, especially of Mount Washington and the southern Presidentials to the north and of the Pemigewasset Wilderness to the west. Its remoteness and length of hike make it a challenging but rewarding peak for dedicated hikers. Mount Isolation lives up to its name: situated in the middle of the Dry River Wilderness, it is one of the most remote peaks in the Whites. It is the highest summit on the Montalban Ridge, a long spur extending south from Mount Washington. Because of its remoteness, any approach is roughly a 12 to 14 mile round-trip, making it a challenging day hike. One of the earliest trails in this area was the Davis Path, opened in 1845 by local hotelier Thomas J. Davis. Davis built this bridle path from Crawford Notch all the way to Mount Washington’s summit. On its way, the Davis Path traversed near Mount Isolation (just a short spur off the main trail). In the 19th century, tourists would take the Davis Path to Mount Washington, and a few intrepid ones bagged Isolation by this spur – thus Isolation, though remote, has been known to climbers for over 150 years. The Davis Path fell into disuse by the late 1800s but was reopened in the early 1900s by the AMC. Besides explorers and hikers, Mount Isolation has seen little human impact: no logging railroads reached its slopes (being in the Presidential Range’s shadow, the terrain was too rough), though some logging occurred in the Dry River valley to its west in the 1890s. In 1975, the area around Isolation was designated as part of the Presidential Range–Dry River Wilderness, further protecting it. There are no buildings on Isolation – never were – but an interesting artifact remained for years: on the summit ledge, hikers in the mid-20th century established a “register” (a glass jar or canister containing a notebook). Notably, legendary hiker Guy Waterman reported on the Isolation register in the 1980s as one of the most remote and thus intriguing ones (it’s since been removed per wilderness policy). Isolation’s open granite slab at the summit yields outstanding views: Mount Washington’s cone dominates the north, and the southern vista extends over the Wild River and Pemi wildernesses. Many hikers reach this peak and feel a sense of historical continuity – treading the same quiet ridge that 19th-century pathfinders did. The long miles and the mountain’s name often prompt reflections on solitude and perseverance. Mount Isolation hasn’t changed much since those early explorers set foot here, and that is precisely its charm: it’s a time capsule of wilderness in a range increasingly tamed by trails and roads.
Mount Tecumseh – Mount Tecumseh is a 4,003-foot mountain in Grafton County, New Hampshire. It is the shortest mountain among the 48 NH 4,000-footers. Mount Tecumseh is part of the Sandwich Range and is most famous as the home of Waterville Valley Resort; ski trails cut through its northeastern slope. The mountain was named after the famous Shawnee chief Tecumseh. A hiking trail (the Mount Tecumseh Trail) leads to its summit from the ski area base. The summit is wooded, but a few outlook points near the top, and on ski trails, can provide views towards neighboring mountains like Mount Osceola, and down to the Waterville Valley. Mount Tecumseh’s modest elevation and accessible trail make it a popular hike, especially for beginners working on the 4,000-footer list. Mount Tecumseh is the shortest of the 48 four-thousand footers, located in the Sandwich Range and most famous as the home of the Waterville Valley Ski Area (its north side is carved by ski trails). The mountain was named after Chief Tecumseh, the renowned Shawnee leader who led a confederation of tribes in the early 1800s. Interestingly, Tecumseh never set foot in New England – he was based in the Ohio Valley and died in 1813 – but during the mid-19th century there was a vogue for naming peaks after notable Native American chiefs (despite no local connection). It’s likely that “Tecumseh” was chosen by mapmakers around the 1850s for this mountain, perhaps complementing other Native American names in the region (like nearby Mount Osceola, named for the Seminole chief). For a long time, Mount Tecumseh was relatively obscure because of its modest height and wooded summit. However, it gained prominence when in January 1966 the Waterville Valley ski resort opened. The founders (Tom Corcoran and partners) built trails and lifts on Tecumseh’s north slope, instantly making it accessible. The ski area proudly notes that it’s on one of the NH 4,000-footers. In the 1970s, with the rise of the 4,000-footer hiking craze, many people “checked off” Tecumseh by ascending via the Mount Tecumseh Trail, which follows alongside a ski slope for part of the way. Mount Tecumseh also saw precise surveying: in August 2019, using GPS technology, a survey found that the summit is actually about 3,997 feet above sea level (slightly lower than the long-accepted 4,003). Despite dropping just below the 4,000-foot threshold, it remains on the official list (with a footnote). Historically, Tecumseh’s area had some logging in the 19th century (the Thornton Gore and upper Mad River areas) but nothing notable on the summit. There were never any fire towers or major structures on the top; the ski area brings infrastructure only up to about 3,600 feet. One quirky historical event: in 1931, a small plane crash-landed on Mount Tecumseh’s flank (the pilot survived and hiked out). Today, hikers often note a commemorative sign near the start of the trail explaining the origin of the name. As the last on the list alphabetically and by height, Mount Tecumseh is sometimes the first or last peak aspiring “NH48” finishers tackle. Its gentle grades and short distance make it a popular hike for beginners. At the summit (which has a limited outlook just beyond), there’s a peaceful feeling – one can ponder the intersection of natural history and human history: a Native American namesake, an evolving understanding of elevation, and a mountain that went from unknown to beloved through recreation.
Wildcat Mountain (D Peak) – Wildcat Mountain “D” Peak is a 4,050-foot summit on Wildcat Mountain, located in Coös County, New Hampshire. It is at the northwest end of the Wildcat Ridge, directly above the Wildcat Mountain Ski Area in Pinkham Notch. Wildcat D is one of two summits of Wildcat Mountain recognized as 4,000-footers (the other being the higher “A” Peak). The summit of Wildcat D is the site of the top of a gondola lift and an observation deck, from which there are spectacular views across Pinkham Notch to Mount Washington and the Presidential Range. Wildcat D Peak is often the starting or ending point for hikers traversing the Wildcat Ridge Trail, which runs from Pinkham Notch over Wildcat’s peaks and on toward Carter Dome. Wildcat “D” Peak is one of two summits of Wildcat Mountain that qualify as 4,000-footers (the other being Wildcat A). Wildcat D is unique in that it sits at the top of the Wildcat Mountain Ski Area, directly across Pinkham Notch from Mount Washington. In January 1958, Wildcat Ski Area made history by opening the first gondola lift in the United States – a lift that carried skiers from the base up to Wildcat D’s summit ridge. This “Wildcat Gondola” was a European-built 2-person enclosed cabin lift (sometimes called the “Wildcat Valley Tramway”), and it was revolutionary for American skiing. The governor of NH christened it with a bottle of champagne on opening day. Wildcat thus became one of the premier ski resorts in the East. The original gondola operated until 1999 (with a few incidents, including a notable rollback accident in its first season 1958 which fortunately caused no fatalities but led to improved safety standards). It was replaced by a modern cable car and later by a high-speed chairlift, though even today in summer the ski area sometimes runs a few gondola cabins for scenic rides. At the summit of Wildcat D there is an observation deck (near the top of the lift) which has spectacular views across Pinkham Notch to Tuckerman Ravine and Mount Washington – this is one of the most photographed views in the White Mountains, and it has been a draw since the 19th century when tourists would climb or ride up Glen Ellis Falls trail to get a view from Wildcat’s ledges. The Wildcat range itself got its name from the catamounts that were once common in the area; while none remain, hikers in the early 1900s occasionally reported seeing tracks or hearing screams attributed to these elusive predators. Wildcat D’s summit area is partly cleared due to ski operations, but it’s within the White Mountain National Forest on a long-term lease. The Appalachian Trail was re-routed to pass over Wildcat D (and use the gondola area) when the AT was established in the 1930s. For thru-hikers, the sudden encounter with a ski summit station – complete with gondola, cafeteria (in season), and crowds of tourists – can be surreal after miles in wilderness. It’s a reminder of how the White Mountains have been a multi-use landscape. The third-generation tram (planned for the late 2020s) will continue Wildcat’s legacy as a ski innovator. Meanwhile, hikers still traverse Wildcat Ridge for the challenge and the views, experiencing both the wild aspect of “Wildcat” on the rugged trail and the modern recreation at Wildcat D. The juxtaposition is a fascinating part of the mountain’s story, bridging 19th-century lore and 20th-century development.
