        <h2>What is the NH48?</h2>
        <p>
          The New Hampshire 48 refers to mountains that meet the AMC Four-Thousand-Footer Club standard of at least 4,000 feet above sea level and 200 feet of topographic prominence. NH48.info is not affiliated with the AMC; this overview summarizes information gathered from public references and hiker contributions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea dates to 1931 when Dartmouth librarian Nathaniel L. Goodrich outlined an early list. Refined USGS surveys and AMC guidelines eventually set the list at 48 peaks—adding Bondcliff and Galehead while excluding shoulder summits like Mt. Guyot and Mt. Clay. Readers should confirm criteria and routes with the Appalachian Mountain Club before planning trips.

        <p>
          The AMC Four-Thousand-Footer Club launched officially in 1957 to encourage hikers into the deeper corners of the White Mountain National Forest. According to AMC guidelines, a peak must have 200 feet of prominence from any connecting col. Human-powered ascents are expected—using the Cog Railway or Cannon’s tramway does not meet the guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thousands of finishers log their climbs by mailing the AMC application or joining online trackers. Please read the Appalachian Mountain Club’s introductory letter for the most accurate and current requirements, and verify any summary here with the official resource.

          <strong>Which NH 4,000 footer is the easiest?</strong>
          <p>Mt. Tecumseh and Mt. Waumbek are widely considered the most approachable thanks to short mileage, steady grades, and sheltered routes; however, experiences vary.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <strong>Do winter ascents count toward the regular NH48 list?</strong>
          <p>Many hikers count winter ascents toward the primary list and separately for the Winter NH48 award. December 21–March 21 is the commonly accepted window; review AMC criteria to be sure.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <strong>Which range has the most dangerous weather?</strong>
          <p>The Presidential Range is often cited for challenging weather. Above-treeline exposure, fast-moving storms, and wind chills make even summer days serious—plan conservatively.</p>
