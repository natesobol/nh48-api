It was named for Thomas Crawford, a 19th-century innkeeper of Crawford Notch (and part of the family for whom Crawford Notch is named). Mount Tom is often hiked together with neighboring Mount Field and Mount Willey. The summit of Mount Tom is forested with no direct views, but just below the summit, hikers can find viewpoints that offer vistas toward the Presidential Range and down into Crawford Notch. A notable feature on its slopes is the bird population; Mount Tom is known as a good place to spot Canada jays near the summit.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Tom_%28New_Hampshire%29","https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/357730949","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6924141","https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6927"]}}</script>
