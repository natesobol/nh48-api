<article class="experience-item"><h3>Planning tip</h3><p>Kinsman Ridge Trail - via Lonesome Lake and Hi-Cannon. - 5.9 - 2,300 - Moderate - Loop - semi-loop using Hi-Cannon up, Kinsman Ridge down. Yes - Lonesome Lake on route; otherwise no flowing water on steep sections. Large parking areas at tram and Lafayette Place; very accessible - may need parking fee at tram lot during tourist season.</p></article>
