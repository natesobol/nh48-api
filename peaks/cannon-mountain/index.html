<article class="experience-item"><h3>Conditions from experience</h3><p>Summer and fall - black flies in spring; winter ascent common via ski slopes or Kinsman Ridge trail. Medium - summit open but a building and tower provide refuge; trail mostly wooded.</p></article>
<article class="experience-item"><h3>Planning tip</h3><p>Kinsman Ridge Trail - via Lonesome Lake and Hi-Cannon. - 5.9 - 2,300 - Moderate - Loop - semi-loop using Hi-Cannon up, Kinsman Ridge down. Yes - Lonesome Lake on route; otherwise no flowing water on steep sections. Large parking areas at tram and Lafayette Place; very accessible - may need parking fee at tram lot during tourist season.</p></article>

It is situated at the northern end of the Franconia Range, overlooking Franconia Notch. Cannon Mountain is known for its nearly vertical east face of cliffs (the site of the former Old Man of the Mountain rock profile) and for the Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway, which carries visitors to near its summit. The mountain is a popular destination for both hiking and skiing (home to Cannon Mountain Ski Area). At the summit, an observation tower provides excellent views of Franconia Notch, the Kinsman Range, and the surrounding White Mountains.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon_Mountain_%28New_Hampshire%29","https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/357731219","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5032778","https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6895"]}}</script>
