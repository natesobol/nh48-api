<article class="experience-item"><h3>Conditions from experience</h3><p>Year-round - popular winter 4k; summer for clear Presidential views from outlook; avoid spring mud. Low - trail sheltered; only concern is typical winter cold at viewpoint.</p></article>
<article class="experience-item"><h3>Planning tip</h3><p>Starr King Trail - via Mt Starr King. - 7.2 - 2,700 - Moderate - Out &amp; back Limited - no major water sources on trail; an old spring near Starr King summit sometimes flows lightly, but plan to carry water. Small parking area on unpaved Starr King Rd by trailhead sign; if full, park along road without blocking driveways</p></article>
