It is part of the Pliny Range in the northern White Mountains and is the third-highest peak in that range (after Mount Starr King, which is on the same ridge, and Mount Cabot to the east). Mount Waumbek is typically hiked via a trail that passes over Mount Starr King. The summit of Waumbek is wooded, with a limited clearing that provides a restricted view towards the Presidential Range. Being one of the northernmost 4,000-footers, Mount Waumbek is often one of the last peaks hikers climb to complete the NH48 list. The mountain’s name “Waumbek” comes from an Abenaki word, often interpreted to mean “white rock” or “snowy” (perhaps referencing its snowy winters).","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Waumbek","https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/357728727","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6924524","https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6882"]}}</script>
