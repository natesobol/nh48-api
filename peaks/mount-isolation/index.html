True to its name, it is one of the most isolated peaks in the White Mountains, situated in the Dry River Wilderness area at the southern end of the Presidential Range. Mount Isolation is the highest summit on the Montalban Ridge, which extends south from Mount Washington. Hiking to Mount Isolation requires a long journey (generally 12–14 miles round trip), often via Glen Boulder Trail and Davis Path or Rocky Branch Trail and Isolation Trail. The summit of Mount Isolation has an open ledge that yields outstanding views, especially of Mount Washington and the southern Presidentials to the north and of the Pemigewasset Wilderness to the west. Its remoteness and length of hike make it a challenging but rewarding peak for dedicated hikers.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Isolation","https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/357730186","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6921446","https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6971"]}}</script>
