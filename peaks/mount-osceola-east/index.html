It is a subordinate peak of Mount Osceola, located to the east of Osceola’s main summit along the ridge in the town of Lincoln (Grafton County). East Osceola is reached via the Greeley Pond Trail and Mount Osceola Trail, typically on the way to or from the main summit of Mount Osceola. The summit of East Osceola is wooded and marked by a cairn, offering little in terms of views. Despite its lack of vistas, it counts as a separate 4,000-footer due to the prominence drop between it and Mount Osceola.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Peak_Mount_Osceola","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5329122","https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/357729942"]}}</script>
