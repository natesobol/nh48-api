The mountain is named after Passaconaway, a legendary 17th-century sachem (chief) of the Pennacook people. Mount Passaconaway is densely wooded on top; its summit is tree-covered with a small cairn marking the high point. Although the summit itself has no view, a short spur path leads to a clearing with an excellent southward outlook. Mount Passaconaway is often hiked along with neighboring Mount Whiteface, and it is known for its steep, challenging ascents (such as via the Dicey’s Mill Trail or the Walden Trail) and for the wilderness feel of the Bowl Research Natural Area on its eastern flank.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Passaconaway","https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Passaconaway","https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/357730531","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8523440","https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6999"]}}</script>
