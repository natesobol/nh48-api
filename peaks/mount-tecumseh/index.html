          <article class="experience-item"><h3>Experience summary</h3><p>I built this guide around field photography sessions on Mount Tecumseh in Osceola Range - Waterville Valley.. Mount Tecumseh is a 4,003-foot mountain in Grafton County, New Hampshire.</p></article>
<article class="experience-item"><h3>Conditions from experience</h3><p>Year-round - short hike; winter very popular – often well-packed trail; ski trails can offer alternate descent in summer. Low - summit just at treeline; little risk except typical weather; can be windy on ski trails.</p></article>
<article class="experience-item"><h3>Planning tip</h3><p>Mt. Tecumseh Trail - Waterville Valley ski area side. - 5.0 - 2,300 - Moderate - Out &amp; back Yes - Tecumseh Brook runs alongside lower trail for first mile or so on Waterville side; small streams on Tripoli side as well. Plenty of parking at ski area year-round - park near trailhead sign at lot #1.. Tripoli Road side accessible in summer only - unpaved road, fee area.</p></article>
