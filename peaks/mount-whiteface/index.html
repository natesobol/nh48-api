<article class="experience-item"><h3>Conditions from experience</h3><p>Summer and fall - dry ledges easier; winter requires crampons on steep ledges or bypass Tom Wiggin trail – not recommended in spring ice. Medium - exposed ledges can be dangerous when wet/icy; otherwise much of route is forested.</p></article>
<article class="experience-item"><h3>Planning tip</h3><p>Blueberry Ledge Trail - south via Blueberry Ledges. - 8.4 - 2,900 - Moderate/Difficult - Out &amp; back - or loop with Tom Wiggin or Dicey’s Mill. Limited - small brook near start of Blueberry Ledge Trail; none on ridge or upper mountain. Large grassy Ferncroft lot; be respectful - private land around.. No facilities except kiosk</p></article>

The mountain is named for the large white granite cliff on its southeast face. Mount Whiteface’s summit is wooded and marked by a cairn just off the trail with limited views, but just below the summit, open ledges on the Blueberry Ledge Trail provide expansive views south and east, including Lake Winnipesaukee and the Ossipee Range. Mount Whiteface is often climbed together with Mount Passaconaway to its north, and both peaks lie within the White Mountain National Forest’s Sandwich Range Wilderness.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Whiteface","https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3283228471","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6924572","https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=7002"]}}</script>
