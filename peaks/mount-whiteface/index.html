          <article class="experience-item"><h3>Experience summary</h3><p>I built this guide around field photography sessions on Mount Whiteface in Sandwich Range. Mount Whiteface is a 4,020-foot mountain in the Sandwich Range of the White Mountains, straddling the border of Grafton and Carroll counties in New Hampshire.</p></article>
<article class="experience-item"><h3>Conditions from experience</h3><p>Summer and fall - dry ledges easier; winter requires crampons on steep ledges or bypass Tom Wiggin trail – not recommended in spring ice. Medium - exposed ledges can be dangerous when wet/icy; otherwise much of route is forested.</p></article>
<article class="experience-item"><h3>Planning tip</h3><p>Blueberry Ledge Trail - south via Blueberry Ledges. - 8.4 - 2,900 - Moderate/Difficult - Out &amp; back - or loop with Tom Wiggin or Dicey’s Mill. Limited - small brook near start of Blueberry Ledge Trail; none on ridge or upper mountain. Large grassy Ferncroft lot; be respectful - private land around.. No facilities except kiosk</p></article>
