The North Peak stands at 4,180 feet (1,274 m), making it the highest of the Tripyramid trio. It is located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. North Tripyramid, along with Middle Tripyramid, is included on the Appalachian Mountain Club’s list of 4,000-footers. The two peaks are connected by a ridge and separated by a deep col. The summit of North Tripyramid is wooded, but a hike up its steep North Slide (for experienced hikers) or the gentler approach from the south provides views along the way, and there are limited outlooks near the summit itself.","sameAs":["https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1331580889","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34927986","https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6996"]}}</script>
