          <article class="experience-item"><h3>Experience summary</h3><p>I built this guide around field photography sessions on North Tripyramid in Sandwich Range. Mount Tripyramid (North Peak) is one of the three summits of Mount Tripyramid in the Sandwich Range of the White Mountains.</p></article>
<article class="experience-item"><h3>Conditions from experience</h3><p>Late summer and fall - North Slide dry; winter ascents use slide with caution – icy. High - on slide route – dangerous when wet or icy; wooded route is low exposure.</p></article>
<article class="experience-item"><h3>Planning tip</h3><p>Pine Bend Brook Trail &gt; Mt. Tripyramid Trail - North Slide up, South Slide down loop. - 11.0 - 3,100 - Difficult - Loop - over Middle Peak. Yes - Pine Bend Brook along lower trail provides water for first couple miles; none on upper mountain. Roadside pull-off on Kanc - no formal lot; park off pavement.</p></article>
