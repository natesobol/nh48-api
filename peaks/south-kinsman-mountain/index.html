It is the higher of the two main peaks of Kinsman Mountain, which is part of the Kinsman Range in the White Mountains. South Kinsman is the sixth most prominent peak in the White Mountains and marks the highest point between Franconia Notch and Kinsman Notch. The summit is mostly open with scrub vegetation, offering expansive views westward and into the Franconia Range. South Kinsman, together with North Kinsman, is considered one of the New Hampshire 4,000-footers since the two peaks are separated by enough elevation drop to qualify individually.","sameAs":["https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/357730786","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34909503"]}}</script>
