Wildcat D is one of two summits of Wildcat Mountain recognized as 4,000-footers (the other being the higher “A” Peak). The summit of Wildcat D is the site of the top of a gondola lift and an observation deck, from which there are spectacular views across Pinkham Notch to Mount Washington and the Presidential Range. Wildcat D Peak is often the starting or ending point for hikers traversing the Wildcat Ridge Trail, which runs from Pinkham Notch over Wildcat’s peaks and on toward Carter Dome.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat_Mountain_(New_Hampshire)","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8001021","https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5550578026"]}}</script>
