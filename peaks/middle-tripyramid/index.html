Like North Tripyramid, its summit is wooded with no direct views. The peaks are often hiked together via the Mt. Tripyramid Trail (which ascends the steep North Slide and descends the South Slide), and hikers can find good views from the slide areas or from Scaur Ridge nearby. Middle Tripyramid just meets the prominence requirement above the col with North Tripyramid to count as a distinct summit.","sameAs":["https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1331579182","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34927972","https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6997"]}}</script>
