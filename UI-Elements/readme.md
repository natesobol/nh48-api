## SEO Notes for Media Assets

* Use descriptive, hyphenated filenames (e.g., `white-mountain-hiking-icon.png`) to reinforce keywords like **“White Mountain trails”** and **“NH48 summit photos.”**
* Pair every image with ALT text and captions in templates to support accessibility and improve image search rankings.
* Keep hero graphics lightweight so pages featuring **New Hampshire hiking data** maintain fast performance and strong Core Web Vitals.
